ABSTRACT
Brazil is the world's leading producer and exporter of coffee, with an increasing adoption of conservation-oriented practices. However, the edaphic effects of agroecological systems, particularly in topographically diverse landscapes, remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the physical and chemical attributes of soils under shaded coffee agroforestry systems across three slope positions, upper third (UT), middle third (MT), and lower third (LT), as well as a native forest area (NF), used as a reference. The soil samples were analyzed for texture, bulk density, porosity, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and macro- and micronutrient contents. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied, including MANOVA, principal component analysis (PCA), and Bayesian network modeling to explore the interactions among the soil attributes. The PCA explained 60.2% of the total variance across the first two principal components, with 38.5% attributed to PC1 (physical structure and fertility) and 21.7% to PC2 (organic matter quality). Cos² values indicated a strong representation of total porosity (0.78) and microporosity (0.60) along PC1. The UT exhibited greater macroporosity (>15%) and lower bulk density (1.12 g cm-³), while the LT displayed higher TOC levels (>2.5%) and microporosity (~30%), reflecting colluvial accumulation and increased compaction. The C/N ratio was identified as a key structuring variable on PC2. Bayesian networks highlighted TOC as a central integrator among porosity, acidity, and nutrient availability, with the highest centrality observed in conserved environments. Overall, shaded coffee cultivation enhanced soil quality and functionality, particularly in upper slope areas.

Core Ideas
    1. Topography modulates soil porosity and carbon in shaded coffee agroforestry systems.
    2. Multivariate analysis revealed fertility and organic matter as distinct functional gradients.
    3. Total organic carbon integrates acidity, nutrient availability, and pore structure.
    4. Lower slopes showed compacted soils with high TOC and microporosity.

Plain Language Summary

Shaded coffee agroforestry systems can improve soil health, but how soil properties vary along hillslopes and depths is still unclear. This study examined a coffee system in northeastern Brazil to assess how topographic position and soil depth affect nutrients and organic matter. We analyzed various soil properties and used statistical tools to explore their interactions. Results showed that lower slopes had more nutrients and organic carbon, while deeper layers were less fertile. The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio indicated differences in organic matter quality, independent of total carbon. These findings suggest that managing coffee systems with attention to slope and depth can improve soil conservation and productivity.

INTRODUCTION
Coffee growing (Coffea spp., Rubiaceae) is one of the most important perennial agricultural activities in the tropics. In Brazil, the historical leader in global production and exports, the 2016 harvest totaled 51.36 million bags, which represented 33.4% of the world’s production, with exports of more than 578,000 tons in the first months of 2017 alone (CONAB, 2017). 
This coffee production chain supports around 8.4 million jobs and is strategic for the economy of small and medium-sized producers, especially in mountainous areas (Fassio and Silva, 2015). However, the production intensification based on conventional systems, with intensive application of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides and mechanization in sloping areas, has triggered accelerated processes of tropical soil degradation (Lal, 2015; Gupta, 2019).
The soil degradation in conventional coffee systems manifests itself through a reduction in total organic carbon stocks, structural breakdown, increased bulk density and water erosivity, acidification, nutrient leaching and depletion of cation exchange capacity (Harmand et al., 2007; Sauvadet et al., 2019b; Ferreira et al., 2022). These processes directly affect critical edaphic functions such as water retention, the supply of mineralizable nitrogen and the resilience of soils to water erosion (Blanco-Sepúlveda et al., 2024b).
In an effort to contain these depletions, agroforestry systems with shaded coffee have become an alternative adopted by farmers interested in sustainable production practices (de Carvalho et al., 2021). In these systems, the presence of native tree species, which are almost always large, plays a fundamental role in modulating the soil biogeochemical and structural processes (Gomes et al., 2020; Jawo et al., 2024).
These tree species contribute directly to enriching organic matter, improving fertility and stimulating microbial activity. This promotes greater nutrient retention and carbon fixation (Sauvadet et al., 2019a). In addition, the shade provided by these trees helps reduce temperature and evaporation, maintaining a more stable and favorable microclimate for the coffee tree development (Hidayat et al., 2024). 
In addition, the deposition of litter in these environments contributes to the formation of humic substances, the stabilization of aggregates through glomalins and mucilages, and the retention of nutrients via organo-mineral interactions in colloidal microdomains (Six et al., 2002; Chenu et al., 2019). In cases where soils are highly weathered, such as Latosols and Argissols, with mineralogy dominated by Fe and Al oxides, these mechanisms are crucial for the physical and chemical stabilization of the soil organic matter (Kazmierczak and et al., 2020).
Shading also acts as a physical barrier against water erosion. Studies have shown that soil cover by plant residues in these systems can reduce runoff losses by up to 90% (Getachew et al., 2023). At the same time, it attenuates the speed of raindrops, resulting in a reduction in the surface water erosion of the soil (Piato et al., 2020).
In addition, the microclimate modulation provided by shading canopies reduces the temperature range, promotes the water infiltration and stimulates functional microbial communities, resulting in increased nutrient mineralization and the stability of cycles such as N and C (Sauvadet et al., 2019b; Tully et al., 2020). 
The topographic position is another key factor that modulates the soil functionality in coffee systems. In mountainous tropical environments, toposequences influence the redistribution of sediment, water and soil organic matter through processes such as leaching, laminar erosion and surface runoff (Meylan et al., 2017; Sartori et al., 2020). Higher slope areas tend to maintain higher stocks of total organic carbon, greater aggregate stability and greater microbial enzyme activity, while lower positions often show compaction, accumulation of exchangeable aluminum and reduced effective porosity, which compromises the water storage and the root oxygenation.
Despite advances in understanding the benefits of agroforestry systems, there are still gaps in the integrated understanding of the mechanisms that involve the interaction between shading, topography and soil functionality (Moura et al., 2019). Most current studies focus on isolated analyses of physical, chemical or microbiological attributes, calling into question the systemic approach needed to assess soil quality in tropical agroecosystems. Few studies simultaneously evaluate variables such as soil density and porosity, pH, cation exchange capacity, nutrient stocks, microbial biomass carbon and enzymatic activity along topographic gradients and under different vegetation covers (Lazzaretti et al., 2019; Bastida et al., 2021).
These integrated parameters provide sensitive indicators of the soil quality. Among the most promising are the stratified stock of total organic carbon, the carbon/nitrogen ratio of the litter, the activity of hydrolytic enzymes such as β-glucosidase and oxidative enzymes such as phosphatase, and the indices of aggregate stability and microbial biomass carbon (Blanco-Sepúlveda et al., 2024a). These indicators make it possible to assess the soil's ability to maintain essential ecosystem functions, especially in environments subject to anthropogenic pressures and severe soil and climate restrictions.
Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the interactions between physical, chemical and biological soil attributes and their influence on total organic carbon (TOC) in shaded coffee agroforestry systems using network modeling and principal component analysis and also aimed to evaluate the combined effects of shading by native trees and topographic position on physical, chemical and microbiological soil attributes in agroforestry coffee plantations in the municipality of Taquaritinga do Norte, Pernambuco state.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
The research was carried out on the Várzea da Onça farm in the municipality of Taquaritinga do Norte, which belongs to the Borborema Plateau geoenvironmental unit in the state of Pernambuco (Figure 1), at the geographical coordinates 7° 53'17'' South and 36° 5'33'' West. In the area, the predominant relief is called Brejo de Altitude, located on the banks of the PE-130 highway, approximately 12 km from the PE-104 highway. The region's soil is classified as Typical Eutrophic Red Yellow Argisol (Argissolo Vermelho Amarelo Eutrófico Típico), medium/clayey texture, with a prominent A horizon, local vegetation is of the subperennial forest type and mountainous relief (Santos et al., 2018).

The region's climate is classified as Aw, a tropical climate with dry winters, mountainous terrain with deep, narrow valleys; the highest rainfall is recorded between February and August, with an annual average of 721 mm, an average annual temperature of 21°C and an altitude of between 736 m and 1,100 m (Koppen, 1936). 
Two areas were used in the experiment, one with native vegetation and the other with coffee plantations intercropped with native vegetation called shaded coffee, subdivided into three plots: Upper Third (TS), Middle Third (TM) and Lower Third (TI). 
Native vegetation: The experimental area covers 4.57 ha and is made up of native tree species ranging in height from 20 to 35 meters. Based on the floristic survey carried out, the following species were identified in the regenerating secondary vegetation: Tabebuia serratifolia (pau-d'arco), Anacardium occidentale L. (cashew), Cordia goeldiana (freijó), Calomys tener, Cecropia sp. (embaúba), Spondias purpurea (ciriguela), Ceiba glaziovii (barriguda), Acacia glomerosa, Copaifera langsdorffii (copaíba), Spondias mombin (cajá), Ficus sp. (gameleira), Guazuma ulmifolia (mutamba), Styrax leprosus, and Psidium australe Cambess (aracaeiro).
In addition to these, other species of regional occurrence were observed: Galezia gorazema Moq., Rubus sp. (Rosaceae), Inga subnuda Salzm. ex Benth., Caesalpinia leiostachya Benth. Ducke, Copaifera trapezifolia Hayne, Roupala cearaensis Sleumer, Cedrela sp., Terminalia sp., Oreopanax capitatum Decne et Planch. var. multiflorum (DC.) E. March, Manilkara rufula (Miq.) Lam, Aspidosperma pyricollum Müll. Arg., and Tabebuia avellanedae Lorentz ex Griseb., according to Souza et al. (2025).
Shaded coffee (Figure 2): The cultivation used was rustic with little alteration of the forest, the area used was 25.59 ha and more than ten years of planting coffee Coffea arabica L. The percentage of shade generated by the native vegetation for the coffee was around 75%. The coffee seedlings were planted in an area of native vegetation, where holes were dug 0.40 x 0.40 m wide and deep, 2 m apart. The cultivation methods used were organic fertilization using manure and chicken litter, thinning with a hand-held brush cutter and tree pruning.

Six trenches were opened in each area, 50 m apart, with dimensions of 1.5 x 1.5 m and a depth of 0.80 m, for the three relief positions. In each trench, deformed and undeformed soil samples were collected for physical and chemical analysis at depths of 0-0.20, 0.20-0.40 and 0.40-0.60 m, and for microbiological analysis deformed samples at depths of 0-0.05 m.
The granulometric analysis of the solid soil particles was carried out using the densimeter method (Gee and Or, 2002). The soil density was obtained using the volumetric ring method described by Grossman and Reinsch, (2018). The total porosity was obtained using the direct method, according to Teixeira et al., (2017).
The pore size distribution (Equation 1) was calculated by analyzing the soil water retention curve (SWRC) and initially calculating the soil porosity.

Potential acidity - H+Al, sum of bases - SB, potential cation exchange capacity - T, effective cation exchange capacity - t, base saturation - V and aluminum saturation - m, were determined and calculated according to Teixeira et al. (2017).
Statistical analysis
The data was submitted to multivariate analysis of variance using a Multivariate General Linear Model (GLM) with bootstrap resampling (n = 1000), with the aim of simultaneously evaluating the effect of topographic position (upper, middle, lower third and native forest), soil depth (0-0.20, 0.20-0.40 and 0.40-0.60 m) and the interaction between these factors on different functional sets of soil physical attributes. The choice of multivariate GLM, rather than traditional ANOVA, is justified by the presence of multiple intercorrelated dependent variables and the fact that GLM offers greater flexibility in terms of the shape of the distribution and residuals, and is more robust in situations with small or heteroscedastic samples.
The model was adjusted using the gamma distribution and the identity link function, selected on the basis of the best performance of the model according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The assumption of homogeneity of covariance between the groups was met, as indicated by the Box M test. Multivariate normality was considered plausible based on the distribution of residuals and the robustness of the model with resampling.
All main effects and interactions were evaluated using multivariate statistics (Pillai's trace, Wilks' Lambda, Hotelling's trace and Roy's largest root). The significance of the effects was monitored by estimating the partial effect size (partial η²), interpreted according to Cohen’s criteria (2013), small (η² > 0.01), moderate (η² > 0.06) and large (η² > 0.14). When significant main effects or interactions were identified, pairwise multiple comparisons were carried out with Bonferroni correction, which controls type I error in multiple tests and is recommended for samples with moderate variation.
The dependent variables of the physical attributes included in the models were: soil density, total porosity, macroporosity, mesoporosity, total microporosity and cryptoporosity. For the chemical attributes, the following were considered: pH in CaCl₂, available phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potential acidity (H⁺+Al³⁺), sum of bases, effective and potential cation exchange capacity, base saturation and aluminum saturation. The set of variables related to soil organic matter (SOM) included: labile carbon, light organic matter, carbon in fulvic acid, humic acid and humin, total carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio and the stocks of the respective fractions.
The adjusted means were estimated using the marginal means method, and multiple comparisons were carried out with Bonferroni correction. In addition, independent linear regression models were fitted for each soil depth, with the aim of investigating the intra-stratified variation of the attributes as a function of topographic position. The analyses were conducted in the R environment (R Core Team, 2024).

Interactions by Network Analysis 
To model the relationships between soil attributes, we estimated a partial correlation network using a Gaussian graphical model (GGM), regularized via penalty ℓ₁ (LASSO), with automated selection based on the EBIC (Extended Bayesian Information Criterion) criterion, as proposed by Foygel and Drton, (2010). The tuning parameter γ was set at 0.5, which represents a balance between parsimony and model fit, ensuring the exclusion of spurious connections and favoring an interpretable network.
The network was built based on the soil's physicochemical and biological variables. The nodes of the network represent the soil attributes, while the edges indicate the partial correlations between the pairs of variables, adjusted for the presence of the others.
To identify which attributes exert the greatest structural influence on the edaphic system, node centrality metrics were evaluated, as proposed by Opsahl et al. (2010). The metrics included strength, which is understood as the sum of the absolute weights of the connections of each node, reflecting its direct connectivity, proximity, the inverse of the sum of the geodesic distances to the other nodes, indicating accessibility, intermediation as the frequency with which the node is on the minimum paths between pairs of variables, indicating its role as a structural link.
All centrality indices were standardized in z scores. The robustness of the estimates was assessed using a non-parametric bootstrap with 1,000 resamples to calculate confidence intervals for edges and centrality estimates, as well as stability by case-dropping bootstrap.
The centrality stability coefficient (CS-coefficient) was calculated to indicate the maximum proportion of cases that can be excluded without compromising, with 95% confidence, the stability of the order of the most central nodes. As recommended by Epskamp et al. (2018), the minimum acceptable value is 0.25, with values above 0.50 being desirable.
Principal component analysis
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to synthesize variability and identify patterns associated with positions and depths. The variables were standardized (Z-score) and the retention of the components followed the Kaiser rule (eigenvalues > 1), with Varimax rotation. Factor loadings |≥ 0.40| were considered significant. Visualization used biplots of the first two components, with 95% confidence ellipses by position and depth. The analyses were carried out in RStudio (R Core Team, 2024) with the FactoMineR, factoextra and ggplot2 packages.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Soil Chemical Attributes
For chemical attributes, MANOVA detected statistically significant main effects of topographic position, soil depth, and their interaction, indicating that the spatial distribution of soil chemical attributes was influenced by both position along the slope and vertical stratification in the profile. The attributes evaluated included pH in CaCl₂, exchangeable aluminum (Al³⁺), potential acidity (H⁺+Al³⁺), sum of bases (SB), cation exchange capacity at pH 7.0 (CEC), base saturation (V%), and aluminum saturation (m%).
Multivariate statistics were robust, with Pillai's Trace = 2.436; F(18, 99) = 23.77; p < 0.001 and Wilks' Lambda = 0.0002; F(18, 88) = 94.00; p < 0.001, indicating that the combined variation in chemical attributes differed significantly among the factors analyzed. The magnitude of Pillai's Trace suggests a large proportion of variance in the dependent variables explained by the predictors, while the extremely low value of Wilks' Lambda denotes minimal unexplained multivariate variance.
From an edaphic perspective, these results imply that toposequence position modulates chemical fertility gradients, with upper slope positions often exhibiting higher pH, lower Al³⁺ activity, and greater base saturation due to better drainage and reduced leaching of base cations (Souza et al., 2023). In contrast, lower slope positions tend to accumulate exchangeable aluminum and potential acidity, reflecting colluvial deposition and possibly greater water saturation, which may intensify base leaching and favor acidification (Zhou et al., 2024). The significant interaction between slope position and depth reinforces that nutrient distribution patterns and acidity dynamics are not uniform across the profile, but rather shaped by the interplay between lateral and vertical transport processes in the landscape (Biotto et al., 2022).
Large effect sizes for topographic position (F(18, 99) = 23.391; p < 0.001; partial η² = 0.810) and depth (F(12, 64) = 14.250; p < 0.001; partial η² = 0.728), combined with a significant interaction (F(36, 216) = 5.23; p < 0.001; partial η² = 0.466), indicate that vertical processes, such as base cation leaching, Al³⁺ mobilization, and organic matter mineralization, modulate the chemical contrasts imposed by topography. These results are in line with the conceptual models proposed by Lu et al. (2025), who demonstrated that hydropedological gradients in agroecosystems influence soil functioning at the physicochemical and microbiological levels.
 Specifically, zones with better drainage and greater organic matter retention exhibited enhanced representation of genes involved in nitrification, phosphatase activity, and organic matter decomposition, while hydromorphic zones with prolonged saturation showed reductions in these functions along with increases in genes linked to anaerobic pathways (Weintraub et al., 2015). In the present study, the contrasts between upslope and downslope positions in pH, CEC, and base saturation correspond to similar changes in microbial functional potential, reinforcing that topography-driven chemical patterns have cascading effects on biogeochemical processes and nutrient turnover (Ding et al., 2025).
At the univariate level, pH in CaCl₂ (Figure 3) showed statistically significant differences with a high power of effect for the Upper Third (TS) in relation to the Middle Third (TM) (ΔM = 1.080; 95% CI [0.769; 1.391]; p < 0.001; d = 1.488), suggesting lower acidity in the highest slope positions. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in exchangeable Al³⁺ in TS vs. TM (ΔM = –1.800; 95% CI [–2.037; –1.563]; p < 0.001; d = –21.228) and in potential acidity (H⁺+Al³⁺) (ΔM = –3.147; 95% CI [–3.603; –2.692]; p < 0.001; d = –19.282). Mechanistically, these patterns are consistent with reduced hydromorphic stress and better aeration at upper slope positions, which limit Al³⁺ solubilization and acidification. 
Elevated positions also tend to accumulate more stable organic matter and reactive clay minerals, increasing the density of negative charges and enhancing cation retention (Sujatha et al., 2021; Solly et al., 2020). According to Długosz & Piotrowska-Długosz (2024), this combination of organic and mineral surface activity not only elevates CEC but also sustains enzymatic activities involved in C and N turnover, reinforcing the chemical buffering capacity of these zones.

Figure 3: Adjusted averages of soil chemical attributes by depth and topographic position



Consistently, TS displayed significantly higher effective CEC (t) and potential CEC (T = SB + H⁺+Al³⁺), with ΔM = 3.427 (95% CI [2.627; 4.228]; p < 0.001; d = 1.870) and ΔM = 4.775 (95% CI [4.075; 5.475]; p < 0.001; d = 1.803), respectively. This may reflect a higher abundance of colloidal complexes and organo-mineral associations that stabilize negative charges, favoring base cation retention. Sujatha et al. (2021) and Yang et al. (2022) have shown that CEC correlates positively with organic carbon and clay content, with topographically elevated zones favoring accumulation of both.
The positive difference in base saturation (V%) in TS compared to TM (+48.53%; CI 95% [43.050; 54.020]; p < 0.001; d = 1.783) and the lower aluminum saturation (m%) (ΔM = –57.88%; 95% CI [–66.000; –49.775]; p < 0.001; d = –19.921) confirm that topography exerts strong control over the composition of the exchange complex. In upper slopes, lower susceptibility to seasonal water saturation maintains aerobic conditions, enhancing nutrient cycling and exchangeable base retention (Rasmussen et al., 2010). However, even in these favorable zones, m% values above 20% indicate persistent acidity constraints typical of highly weathered tropical soils.
In contrast, lower slope positions are likely affected by seasonal hydromorphia, creating reducing conditions that mobilize Fe and Mn, increase Al³⁺ solubility, and immobilize phosphorus through precipitation or adsorption onto reduced iron surfaces. Crespo et al. (2022) documented similar patterns in hillside systems in northeastern Brazil, while Lu et al. (2025) demonstrated that such hydromorphic zones often have lower abundance of microbial functional genes linked to P solubilization and nitrification, reducing nutrient bioavailability. In these contexts, management strategies such as targeted liming and controlled drainage could mitigate acidity and restore nutrient cycling efficiency (Alves et al., 2024).
Differences between TS and TM persisted at 0.20–0.40 m for pH in CaCl₂ (ΔM = 1.147; 95% CI [0.837; 1.458]; p < 0.001; d = 1.930), suggesting greater buffering capacity at elevated positions. This buffering may be due to stable organo-mineral complexes with high ligand-binding capacity, which slow acid cation mobility (Yang et al., 2022). At 0.40–0.60 m, although mean pH was marginally higher in cultivated upper slope soils, differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). This reflects a tendency toward chemical homogenization in deeper layers, where ionic diffusion and vertical percolation dominate. Patrick et al. (2024) have attributed similar depth trends to gradual alkalinity migration from surface horizons.
CEC values (t and T) declined markedly with depth, with maxima at 0–0.20 m. At this depth, TS showed statistically higher values than TM, indicating a greater concentration of negative charges in colloids, likely tied to higher organic matter inputs and reduced erosion losses. These patterns are consistent with conservation-oriented systems where surface stability enhances nutrient retention and microbial biomass N (Długosz & Piotrowska-Długosz, 2024). Potential acidity and Al³⁺ were also significantly lower at 0–0.20 m in TS vs. TM. In deeper layers, the trend toward lower acidity at upper positions persisted, even if not statistically significant, reflecting weaker leaching and slower accumulation of exchangeable acidity in these profiles.
In the surface horizon, higher V% and lower m% in TS indicate a chemically more favorable environment, with greater base availability and reduced Al³⁺ toxicity risk for roots (Whitley et al., 2019). Eshetu et al. (2024) emphasize that such favorable surface chemistry can amplify nutrient-use efficiency and support microbial functional networks, as also demonstrated by Lu et al. (2025) in agroforestry soils, where high CEC and balanced base saturation correlated with denser and more resilient microbial co-occurrence networks.

Physical attributes of the soil
For the physical attributes of the soil, the MANOVA results indicated statistically significant effects of topographic position, depth and the interaction between the two. The multivariate model showed significant values in the Pillai and Wilks' tests, with Pillai's Trace = 1.541; F(12, 96) = 4.830; p < 0.001 and Wilks' Lambda = 0.092; F(12, 96) = 5.32; p < 0.001, confirming significant multivariate differences between the different positions along the toposequence.
Specifically, the topographic position factor had a significant effect on the set of physical attributes (F(16, 96) = 4.83; p < 0.001; partial η² = 0.726), indicating that the spatial distribution of the soil's physical structure can be modulated by the relief. The soil depth factor also significantly influenced the physical attributes (F(24, 96) = 2.48; p = 0.006; partial η² = 0.341), although to a lesser extent. The interaction between topographic position and depth was also significant (F(48, 96) = 2.112; p = 0.001; partial η² = 0.340).
At the univariate level, statistically significant effects in the different topographic positions were observed for microporosity between coarse aggregates (F(3, 36) = 22.06; p < 0.001; partial η² = 0.648), cryptoporosity (F(3, 36) = 16.396; p < 0.001; partial η² = 0.577) and total microporosity (F(3, 36) = 13.063; p < 0.001; partial η² = 0.521), all with high effect sizes (partial η² > 0.503). Other attributes also showed statistically significant effects as a function of the topographic position, with moderate to high effects: soil density (F(3, 36) = 8.65; p < 0.001; partial η² = 0.419), total porosity (F(3, 36) = 7.29; p = 0.001; partial η² = 0.378) and macroporosity (F(3, 36) = 6.181; p = 0.002; partial η² = 0.340). 
These findings indicate that smaller diameter porous fractions are particularly sensitive to position in the landscape, due to variations in soil structural stability, intensity of use and organic matter dynamics. This relationship is corroborated by Sarmiento-Soler et al. (2022), who showed that microporosity varies significantly depending on the vegetation cover and the relief, with greater stability in shaded areas and at high altitudes - highlighting the direct role of topography and management in the structural organization of fine pores. In addition, in toposequences, soils in elevated positions tend to exhibit less accumulation of fine particles, greater drainage, intensified biological activity and high levels of organic matter (Ács et al., 2024). These conditions, combined with less anthropogenic disturbance, favor not only the preservation of the physical structure, but also the development of more functionally efficient porosity.
These characteristics contribute to greater pore connectivity and aggregate integrity, especially in soils under perennial vegetation, where root activity plays a fundamental role in maintaining soil architecture (Lee et al., 2024). In addition, long-term organic fertilization promotes greater pore structure stability and pore connectivity, in contrast to management based on inorganic inputs (Ruan et al., 2021).
The distribution of pore diameter is also impacted by the content and quality of organic matter, modulating the retention and movement of water and gases in the soil (Robinson et al., 2022), while root growth tends to be more efficient in soils with greater macroporosity and lower penetration resistance, generally present in less compacted environments with greater structural stability (Zhou et al., 2021). As for the effects of stratification, no statistically significant differences were observed for the physical attributes analyzed: soil density (F(2, 36) = 0.14; p = 0.866; partial η² = 0.008), total porosity (F(2, 36) = 0.81; p = 0.454; partial η² = 0.043) and macroporosity (F(2, 36) = 0.11; p = 0.900; partial η² = 0.006) showed no significant variation along the profile.
As for the Lower Terrace (TI), it showed statistically significant values for total porosity when compared to the Native Forest (MN), with an average difference of ΔM = -5.360 cm³ cm-³ (95% CI [-9.410; -1.310], p = 0.006; d = -0.920), which represents a reduction of approximately 10.5% in relation to the MN (Figure 3). This result may be related to a restriction in total pore volume in the lower elevation areas, which is consistent with studies that identify greater compaction, lower porosity and lower biological activity in the lower positions of toposequences, which are generally subject to the deposition of fine particles and sediments (Yao et al., 2023). In addition, studies show that low-altitude areas have lower stocks of organic matter and lower quality litter, resulting in greater susceptibility to structural compaction (Djukic et al., 2010).
Figure 4 - Physical attributes of the soil in an agroecological system of shaded coffee, in different positions of the toposequence, Taquaritinga do Norte, Pernambuco state, Brazil.

In terms of macroporosity, the comparison between TI and MN indicated a mean difference of ΔM = –1.940 cm³ cm⁻³ (95% CI [–4.550; 0.660], p = 0.204; d = –0.920), representing a relative reduction of approximately 31.1%. Although not statistically significant, this reduction is consistent with the tendency toward structural compaction in lower-slope positions, where geotechnical pressure and reduced input of structuring organic residues can decrease aggregate stability (Sharma et al., 2023). 
Similar patterns were reported by Medeiros et al. (2015), who observed decreases in void ratio and increases in bulk density under progressive applied pressures, indicating the susceptibility of surface layers to compaction. These findings reinforce the importance of management practices that enhance organic residue inputs, such as no-till systems, which, however, may require periodic mechanical interventions (e.g., scarification) to mitigate compaction over time (Santos et al., 2024). Furthermore, long-term adoption of no-till without corrective interventions can lead to subsurface compaction, as evidenced by Steponavičienė et al. (2024), necessitating subsoiling to restore structural quality and maintain productive sustainability.
Microporosity between aggregates was significantly lower in IT compared to MN (ΔM = 2.790 cm³ cm-³; 95% CI [0.520; 5.050], p = 0.011; d = 1.638), reflecting a relative increase of approximately 23.8%. This pattern may be related to changes in intermediate pore connectivity, possibly resulting from the reorganization of structural pores into isolated microcapillaries, limiting the preferential flow and redistribution of water in the profile. These findings are in line with observations by Nunes et al. (2021), who identified structural improvements in the pore distribution of soils under shaded coffee, especially in the meso and macro pore fractions, in contrast to open areas prone to compaction and pore segregation.
Principal Component Analysis - PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to identify multivariate patterns between macronutrients (NT, K, Ca, Mg, TOC, C/N, P), evaluating the effects of topographic position. The first two components (PC1 and PC2) cumulatively explained 75.58% of the total variance (PC1: 56.86%; PC2: 18.72%), revealing distinct edaphic gradients. 
PC1 emerged as the primary fertility axis, characterized by significant negative factor loadings for exchangeable bases (Ca²⁺: -0.443; Mg²⁺: -0.453; K⁺: -0.453) and total organic carbon (TOC: -0.392), with high spatial representativeness (cos² > 0.611 for Ca, Mg, TOC). This component clearly discriminated preferential deposition in the Lower Third (TI), where samples exhibited negative coordinates (PC1 = -4.05 ± 0.54), aligning with the hydrological redistribution model of fine sediments and organic matter. In contrast, the Middle Third (MT: PC1 +0.32 ± 0.12) and Upper Third (TS: PC1 -1.16 ± 0.19) showed lower base saturation and organic content, consistent with erosion processes on convex slopes.
PC2 was an independent geochemical axis, dominated by available phosphorus (P) with a maximum negative factor load (-0.631) and high representation (cos² = 0.522). The segregation of P in relation to other nutrients (K⁺ = 0.241 in PC2) reflects its unique dynamics: low mobility due to preferential adsorption on Fe/Al oxides (constant > 10³ L-kg-¹; Azevedo et al., 2018; Négrel et al., 2024) and complexation with carboxylic groups of organic matter, ligand-promoted dissolution effect (Almeida et al., 2024). 
This selective retention is confirmed by the unstratified topographic distribution with intra-tract variability > 40%, de-characterizing the dominant hydrological control observed in PC1. In addition, the C/N ratio showed a distinct signature in PC2 (cos² = 0.137 vs. 0.081 in PC1), suggesting an association with local biogeochemical processes.The distribution of samples in multivariate space revealed patterns consistent with topographic influence.
The samples from the lower third (TI) were concentrated in regions with more negative PC1 values, indicating a greater accumulation of total nutrients, particularly exchangeable bases (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺) and organic carbon. This result is consistent with the convergence effect of fine materials and organic matter in the lower positions of the toposequence. In turn, the samples from the Middle Third (MT) and Upper Third (UT) tended to be distributed in regions with more positive PC1 values, suggesting lower nutrient accumulation and relative fertility.
The separation of phosphorus from other nutrients may be related to its low mobility in the soil and strong adsorption in specific mineral fractions, such as iron and aluminum oxides (Azevedo et al., 2018; Négrel et al., 2024), as well as complexation with functional groups in organic matter. Therefore, PC2 does not represent a simple axis of organic matter quality, as previously suggested, but rather a geochemical gradient regulated by specific interactions between phosphorus and the edaphic matrix.
Figure 5 - Principal component analysis (PCA) projection of the samples on the plane defined by the first two principal components, (a) considering the soil macronutrients and (b) considering the soil physical attributes.

For the physical attributes (Figure 5b), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that the first two axes (PC1 and PC2) cumulatively explained 60.19% of the total variance (PC1: 38.46%; PC2: 21.74%). PC1 defined a gradient of soil structural organization, characterized by pronounced negative factor loadings for Total Porosity (-0.637) and Macroporosity (-0.527), contrasting with a positive contribution from Total Microporosity (0.559). 
This result shows a combination of macropores and micropores, as evidenced by the high representativeness (cos²) of these variables in the Total Porosity (0.786) and Total Microporosity (0.604) components. Negative PC1 values were associated with soils with open porous architecture and could be attributed to the dominance of macropores, while positive values indicated a predominance of functional micropores for water retention, in line with the dual functionality model of porosity (Medeiros et al., 2020).
The second component (PC2) shows a gradient of mineral compaction and intra-particle porosity, with a significant positive factor load for Particle density (0.801) and negative for Textural microporosity (-0.551). This axis shows a differentiation between soil fractions with a higher content of heavy minerals and smaller volumes of internal micropores, typical of materials with less aggregation or a more compact structure.
 The representation of particle density (cos² = 0.697) and textural microporosity (cos² = 0.330) in PC2 indicates that this component synthesizes fundamental contrasts in the structural organization of the soil, reflecting both the influence of the mineral matrix and the dynamics of fine pores. These results are in line with the findings of Dexter (2004), who demonstrated the intrinsic relationship between the particle density and the porosity architecture in mineral soils. 
The expression of textural microporosity on this main axis corroborates the observations by Pires et al. (2017), who highlight the determining role of pores <30 μm in water retention and structural stability. The asymmetry in the magnitudes of cos² (greater for density than for microporosity) suggests, as proposed by Rabot et al., (2018), that mineralogical attributes often exert greater control over the overall structural variability of the soil than textural parameters of the micro-scale porosity.
In multivariate space, the distribution of samples revealed patterns which are consistent with topographic position. The samples from the Upper Third (TS) were concentrated in regions with more negative PC1 and PC2 values, indicating greater macroporosity, greater total porosity and lower particle density. This behavior may be compatible with conditions of lower compaction and greater structural stability, favored by the higher relief, better drainage and lower degree of anthropogenic disturbance.
On the other hand, the samples from the Lower Third (TI) were predominantly located in regions with positive PC1 and especially PC2 values. These values reflect environments with higher mineral density and fewer structural macropores. However, the higher levels of total organic carbon (TOC) observed in the TI suggest that the colluvial accumulation of organic matter contributes to the development of water retention micropores, justifying its association with total microporosity in the PC1 component. 
This pattern may be the result of a functionally distinct porous organization, modulated by processes of redistribution of organic and mineral material in areas of lower altitude, often subject to hydromorphism and accumulation of fine particles.
These results indicate that the physical structure of the soil along the toposequence can be modulated both by processes related to the position on the slope and the deposition of organic matter, which affects the distribution and function of the porosity on different slopes, management systems and morphopedological contexts (Yuan et al., 2020). This topographic influence acts not only on the contribution of organic matter, but also on the degree of development of the profiles and the connectivity between the structural pores. Soils located on flatter surfaces, associated with sedimentary morphopedological compartments, tend to have a greater effective depth, continuous porosity and a more stable structure, while areas of greater slope and crystalline relief show shallower profiles, susceptible to compaction and porous disconnection (Santos et al., 2023).
In addition, the chemical attributes showed gradients of fertility and accumulation of organic matter also influenced by topographic position, with a higher concentration of nutrients in the lower segments of the slope, as observed by Zhou et al. (2024). 
Structure of Edaphic Interactions by Network Analysis
	A visual inspection of Figure 6 shows the analysis of partial correlation networks that assesses the co-occurrence structure between physical, chemical and biological soil attributes in the different topographic positions. 
In the Upper Third (Figure 6a), network analysis reveals a modular architecture with high functional integration between chemical attributes, characteristic of well-drained soils in high topographic positions. The formation of a cohesive cation exchange core stands out, where the effective CEC (t) shows strong interdependence with exchangeable calcium (Ca²⁺; weight = 0.600) and potassium (K⁺; weight = 0.408), reflecting synergy in the ion retention processes mediated by the permanent charge of clay soils (Brady et al., 2008). This electrostatic cohesion may indicate greater efficiency in fertility mechanisms, with chemical stability favored by drainage (Fontes, 2012).
This behavior may be related to total organic carbon (TOC) acting as a key integrating element, thus establishing positive connections with Ca²⁺ (weight = 0.268) via complexation by calcium bridges (Rowley et al., 2018), association with pH (weight = 0.031) due to the buffering capacity of organic matter, and a negative relationship with K⁺ (weight = -0.044) due to the competition for adsorption sites in 2:1 clays (Sparks, 2013). 
The absence of direct links between TOC and exchangeable aluminium (Al³⁺) or phosphorus (P) shows functional compartmentalization, suggesting that: (i) aluminium toxicity is mitigated by high base saturation, regardless of the organic matter, and (ii) phosphorus dynamics operate in subsystems dissociated from organic cycling (Guppy et al., 2005). This pattern reflects the vertical stratification of biogeochemical processes in toposequences, where oxidative conditions favor the specialization of edaphic pathways (Lal, 2017).
In the Middle Third (Figure 6b), the cohesion of the chemical core was maintained, with significant connections between TOC and Ca²⁺ (0.438), between TOC and base saturation (V%) (0.376) and between V% and aggregate microporosity (0.371). The interaction between TOC and total N was evidenced by the correlation between TOC and K⁺ (0.614), indicating an association between organic stocks and the presence of essential cations. The BSR, represented indirectly by TOC and porous attributes, maintained low connectivity. Negative relationships were evident, such as Al³⁺ K⁺ (-0.229), signaling chemical antagonism between acidity and nutrient availability in intermediate hillside environments.
Figure 6: Interaction networks between the soil physicochemical attributes in different positions of the toposequence (a) Upper Terrace (TS), (b) Middle Terrace (TM), (c) Lower Terrace (TI), (d) Native Forest (MN).





In the lower third (Figure 5c), there is a reduction in the network density, reflected in greater topological dispersion and a reduction in inter-nodal cohesion compared to the upper and middle thirds. Despite this general destructuring, the central core of chemical interactions maintains its integrity, as evidenced by the strong associations between Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and organic matter content (TOC, weight = 0.134) and between CEC and microporosity (weight = 0.181).
Total organic carbon (TOC) displays differential connectivity: while it shows moderate associations with exchangeable calcium (Ca²⁺, weight = 0.390) and pH (weight = 0.183), a complete lack of links is observed with available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable aluminum (Al³⁺). 
This pattern may demonstrate a functional fragmentation of the edaphic processes at low altitudes, where the traditional mechanisms of fertility, P cycling, Al³⁺ neutralization, are dissociated from the dynamics of organic matter (Six et al., 2004; Antonangelo et al., 2020). As for exchangeable potassium (K⁺), it showed topological isolation, without significant connections with acid-base variables (pH, Al³⁺), structural attributes (microporosity) or organic matter indicators (TOC). 
This structural disconnection indicates that the dynamics of K⁺ are decoupled from the main edaphic controls in the landscape. This phenomenon reflects the intrinsic restrictions of hydromorphic environments. This structural isolation of potassium may be associated with the edaphic processes characteristic of hydromorphic environments: the water saturation promotes intensified leaching, drastically reducing the retention of K⁺ in the soil matrix (Alfaro et al., 2004). In addition, there is ionic competition at the exchange sites, where Al³⁺ and H⁺ suppress potassium adsorption (Huang et al., 2011; Ulery, 2012). In addition, microbial activity is compromised, which limits the biogeochemical cycling of the nutrient (Fageria and Stone, 2006).
For the Native Forest (Figure 6d), the network structure showed a higher density of connections and topological complexity. The core between CTC (t), Ca²⁺ and base saturation (V%) was maintained, with edge weights of 0.434, 0.625 and 0.581, respectively. TOC was highly connected to P (0.581), Ca²⁺ (0.390) and Al saturation (-0.442), suggesting greater integration between the chemical functionality and the organic matter quality in systems under perennial cover. 
Also, for the native forest, the negative edge between Al³⁺ and K⁺ (weight = -0.229) may be related to a relationship of functional antagonism: in contexts of greater acidity (greater presence of Al³⁺), the availability of exchangeable potassium tends to be lower. This association may be related to competition between cations for the exchange complex and to aluminum toxicity, which can inhibit the root absorption of K⁺, as observed in acid tropical systems. 
On the other hand, the positive link observed between Al³⁺ and Ca²⁺ (weight = 0.398) may indicate that, in certain conserved edaphic contexts, the functional coexistence between acid and basic cations is possible. In studies related to similar management, this association may be the result of joint adsorption processes on colloidal surfaces or simultaneous release as a result of mineral weathering. Studies have shown that ions such as Ca²⁺ and Al³⁺ can share adsorption sites on minerals such as clays, manganese oxides and aluminosilicates, indicating synergistic interaction on reactive surfaces (Liu et al., 2020; Szymanek et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022). In addition, coprecipitation mechanisms or ionic exchanges involving Ca-Al-containing compounds, such as lamellar double hydroxides, have also been pointed out as responsible for this functional association (Qiu et al., 2022). 
As for pH, the positive connection with available phosphorus (P) (weight = 0.085) reflects the already documented dependence of P availability on soil acidity (Johan et al., 2021). At higher pH (less acidic), phosphorus fixation by iron and aluminum oxides is reduced, increasing its concentration in the soil solution (Barrow, 2017). Although the weight of the edge is moderate, its presence indicates that this relationship persists even after controlling for the effects of variables such as Al³⁺, TOC and Ca²⁺, denoting a conditional association between pH and P, typical of soils under perennial vegetation and with greater chemical stability (Liu et al., 2023).
The higher connections observed in the upper segments and in the native vegetation indicate greater structural cohesion and functional capacity, while the networks in the lower third reveal vulnerability to fragmentation, probably induced by hydromorphia, compaction or surface runoff (Liu et al., 2023). The connectivity between TOC and Ca²⁺, and its absence with Al³⁺, reinforce the hypothesis that organic matter acts as a structuring axis for chemical interactions in conserved environments, as also suggested by Mabagala and Mng'ong'o (2022).
As for the weighting matrix (Figure 7), it shows that in the Upper Terrace (TS) and Native Forest (MN) there are predominant connections between key variables such as Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Calcium (Ca²⁺), Base Saturation (V%) and Effective CTC, which indicates a more integrated and functional chemical structure. These connections support the central role of organic matter as a mediator of chemical and structural interactions, possibly favored by greater plant residue input and less mechanical disturbance in these areas.
Figure 7: Centrality measures for soil physicochemical attributes in networks built for different positions in the toposequence: Upper Third (red), Middle Third (green), Lower Third (blue) and Native Forest (purple). The metrics presented are: Closeness, Betweenness, Strength and Expected Influence. 

Note: The attributes analyzed are the physical (soil density, porosity), chemical (e.g. CTC, pH, nutrients) and structural (e.g. total organic carbon, base saturation) variables, numbered from 1 to 15 according to the legend in the figure. Standardized values (z-score) were used to compare the attributes. Higher centrality patterns indicate greater integration and functional influence of the variable in the network of soil interactions.

In contrast, the network in the lower third (TI) shows a lower density of connections and a predominance of weaker associations, especially involving TOC, Ca²⁺ and macroporosity, indicating a possible functional fragmentation of the network of attributes. This disconnection can be attributed to processes such as hydromorphy, surface compaction and lateral runoff, which reduce the continuity between physical and chemical processes, compromising the structure and the functionality of the soil.
In addition, there was little or no connection between TOC and Al³⁺ in all four positions, showing a functional disconnection between organic matter and toxic elements, which is consistent with the stabilizing role of organic matter in conserved environments. This pattern reinforces that, even under conditions of partial degradation, the organic matter tends to maintain functional selectivity in interactions with cations, prioritizing beneficial elements such as Ca²⁺ and suppressing bonds with Al³⁺, as also evidenced by previous studies.
CONCLUSIONS
The results show that the physical and chemical structure of the soil in shaded coffee agroforestry systems can be modulated by topographic position and the deposition of organic matter, reflecting variations in the porosity patterns, mineral density and organic matter accumulation. 
In the Upper Third, there were more favorable conditions for soil structuring, with greater macroporosity and lower density, indicating a lower degree of compaction and greater structural stability. In the Lower Third, the colluvial accumulation of total organic carbon (TOC) contributed to the predominance of microporosity for water retention, but also to greater mineral density, suggesting a more compacted environment, with functional changes resulting from the relief and the deposition dynamics.
From a physical and chemical point of view, the shaded coffee cultivation system favored a reduction in soil density, while at the same time promoting improvements in chemical quality indicators, with an increase in TOC, pH, potassium (K) and boron (B) levels. 
The principal component analysis for the chemical indicators showed two main axes of variation, the first (PC1) related to general fertility and nutrient accumulation and the second (PC2) related to the quality and the decomposition of organic matter, with the C/N ratio playing a structuring role.
Bayesian network analyses show that the shaded coffee cultivation system has greater functional cohesion in conserved environments, in which chemical attributes are strongly integrated with organic matter. In contrast, the lower areas of the toposequence showed greater structural fragmentation and indications of isolation functional of the soil biota. In these networks, total organic carbon stood out as a central attribute, with consistent associations with acidity, nutrient availability and porosity variables, acting as a functional link between these edaphic domains.
