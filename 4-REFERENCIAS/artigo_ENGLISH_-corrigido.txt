   Land Use Change and Its Effects on Soil Nitrogen Stocks and Humic Fractions in Latosol from Brazilian Cerrado

Abstract
The degradation of tropical soils resulting from land use change represents one of the main challenges to agricultural and environmental sustainability, affecting nitrogen dynamics and ecosystem fertility. This study aimed to quantify total nitrogen stocks and their humic fractions in a Rhodic Latosol under different soil covers, aiming to understand the effects of Cerrado conversion on nitrogen stability and availability. Five land use areas were evaluated in Tocantins state, Brazil: native Cerrado, Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.), African Mahogany (Khaya ivorensis), Teak (Tectona grandis), and Agriculture (soybean/corn rotation). Soil samples were collected to 100 cm depth for determination of total nitrogen and humic fractions (fulvic acids, humic acids, and humin) using advanced chemical and statistical analyses, such as Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Results indicated that Teak presented the highest total nitrogen stocks (11.47 Mg ha?¹), while native Cerrado exhibited the lowest (10.16 Mg ha?¹). Planted forest systems concentrated more stable N fractions (humic acids and humin), associated with greater input of lignified litter, while Agriculture favored accumulation of labile forms (fulvic acids). RDA explained 47% of total variation, evidencing enrichment and stabilization gradients of nitrogen. We conclude that conservation practices based on tree plantations with deep roots and continuous organic input are essential to preserve nitrogen stability and sustainability of tropical Latosols.

1. Introduction
      Soil degradation is recognized as one of the most urgent environmental challenges today, threatening food security, water availability, and ecosystem resilience on a global scale (Ma et al., 2023; Toosi et al., 2025). According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately 33% of the world's soils are degraded, and continuous fertility loss directly threatens the ability to feed a global population estimated at 9.7 billion people by 2050 (FAO and ITPS, 2015). In this context, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger and Sustainable Agriculture), establish ambitious targets to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030 (UNCCD, 2019).
      The conversion of native ecosystems into agricultural and intensive forest areas is among the main vectors of degradation, profoundly altering the biogeochemical dynamics of soils, especially the cycles of carbon and nitrogen, which are fundamental to fertility and ecosystem stability (Lal, 2020; Moraes et al., 2024). In Brazil, the Cerrado, recognized as one of the largest biodiversity hotspots on the planet, occupies about 2 million km² (23% of national territory) and houses the headwaters of eight of the twelve main Brazilian river basins (Klink & Machado, 2005; Sano et al., 2019). Beyond its ecological relevance, the biome plays a strategic role in carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling (Strassburg et al., 2017).
      However, in recent decades, agricultural expansion, driven by soybean, corn, and extensive livestock, has promoted intense deforestation, especially in Tocantins state, whose original cover was 87% Cerrado (Lapola et al., 2014). Between 2000 and 2020, more than 8 million hectares of native vegetation were converted to anthropic uses, making the Cerrado one of the most threatened biomes in the country (MapBiomas, 2021). This conversion accelerates organic matter decomposition, reduces carbon and nitrogen stocks, and compromises the stability of humic fractions, essential components for nutrient retention and soil resilience (Souza et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2024).
      The Rhodic Latosols, predominant in the Cerrado, are highly weathered, with low cation exchange capacity (<4 cmolc kg?¹) and mineralogy dominated by kaolinite and gibbsite (Ker, 1997; Santos et al., 2018). These soils have reduced natural fertility and depend heavily on soil organic matter (SOM), which regulates structure, water retention, microbial activity, and nutrient cycling (Gui et al., 2023; Sanchez, 2019). SOM, through humification, originates humic substances, the most stable and functional fraction of organic matter, whose persistence ranges from decades to millennia (Cotrufo et al., 2021; Lehmann & Kleber, 2015).
      Due to this intrinsic chemical poverty, Latosol fertility becomes intrinsically dependent on soil organic matter (SOM), which represents not only the primary source of nutrients but also plays a central role in soil structuring, water retention, biological activity, and resilience capacity to disturbances (Gui et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Sanchez, 2019).
      Humic substances can be operationally fractionated into three main components based on their differential solubility in acidic and alkaline solutions: fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA), and humin (HUM) (Swift, 1996). Fulvic acids represent the most labile fraction, characterized by lower molecular mass, greater water solubility, higher content of carboxylic and phenolic functional groups, and relatively short soil residence time (years to decades). This fraction is rapidly mineralized by soil microbiota, releasing inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) that can be readily absorbed by plants or lost through leaching and volatilization (Figueiredo et al., 2018; Kalbitz et al., 2003).
      Humic acids constitute the intermediate lability fraction, with greater molecular mass, more condensed and aromatic structure, and lower water solubility. This fraction interacts strongly with soil minerals through cationic bridges (Fe³?, Al³?, Ca²?) and hydrophobic bonds, resulting in greater stability and residence time (decades to centuries). Humic acids play a crucial role in soil aggregation, cation retention, and formation of organomineral complexes that protect nitrogen against rapid mineralization (Feng et al., 2021; Kleber et al., 2015). Finally, humin represents the most recalcitrant and stable fraction, characterized by high molecular mass, highly condensed and aliphatic structure, and strong association with the soil mineral matrix. Humin is practically insoluble in aqueous solutions and highly resistant to microbial decomposition, presenting residence times of centuries to millennia. This fraction constitutes the main compartment for long-term carbon and nitrogen stabilization, acting as a reservoir that minimizes losses through gaseous emissions (N2O, NH3) and leaching (NO3?) (Hedges & Keil, 2001; Lehmann et al., 2022).
      Land use change alters both the quantity and quality of organic inputs, destabilizing these fractions and promoting N losses through leaching and volatilization (Zheng et al., 2023). Studies point to reductions of up to 45% in surface nitrogen stocks after 20 years of Cerrado conversion to agriculture or pasture (Almeida et al., 2024; Maia et al., 2019). Conventional agricultural systems, based on intensive soil preparation, accelerate SOM mineralization and preferentially reduce the most stable fractions (HA and HUM), resulting in relative accumulation of labile forms (FA) and greater vulnerability to nitrogen loss (Silva et al., 2024). In contrast, planted forest systems, such as eucalyptus, teak, and African mahogany, may favor N stabilization, depending on litter quality, root depth, and establishment time (Vogado et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2022).
      Despite advances in studies on carbon and nitrogen in the Cerrado, there remains a significant gap regarding N distribution among humic fractions, an aspect crucial for understanding nutrient stability and availability in tropical soils (Marschner et al., 2008). Each fraction performs distinct functions, affecting plant productivity, soil resilience, and greenhouse gas emissions (Kallenbach et al., 2016; Lehmann et al., 2020).
      Given this, this study is based on the hypothesis that the conversion of Cerrado stricto sensu to agricultural and forest uses alters not only the magnitude of nitrogen stocks but also their functional architecture, reducing stable fractions (HA and HUM) and increasing labile ones (FA). Thus, the objective was to quantify and compare total nitrogen stocks and humic fractions in a Rhodic Latosol under native Cerrado, eucalyptus, African mahogany and teak plantations, and agricultural area, along a 0 to 100 cm profile, aiming to understand the mechanisms of stabilization and nitrogen availability in tropical soils under different land uses.
2. Material and Methods
Study Area
      The research was developed in the municipality of São Valério da Natividade in Tocantins, with a total area of 53.23 ha, at geographic coordinates 11º54'37" S and 48º12'31" W (Figure 1).
   
   Figure 1. Location of experimental areas
   
      The local climate is classified as humid subhumid with moderate water deficiency (C2wA'a"), according to Thornthwaite (1948), with two well-defined seasons: dry winter (May to October) and rainy summer (Thornthwaite, 1948). According to Köppen, the climate is Aw type, with mean annual precipitation of 1,643 mm, mean temperature of 26 °C, and altitude of 320 m. Approximately 90% of the area has slope less than 8°, indicating predominantly flat relief (Cho et al., 2021).
      The soils were classified as Rhodic Latosol, with granular to subaggregate structure, well drained, but poor in nutrients, especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (Santos et al., 2018). Five soil covers were evaluated: Cerrado stricto sensu (native vegetation), Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.), African Mahogany (Khaya ivorensis), Teak (Tectona grandis), and Agriculture (soybean/corn rotation).
      The five experimental areas with different land uses studied were: Cerrado (Sensu Stricto), Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.), African Mahogany (Khaya ivorensis), Teak (Tectona grandis), and Agriculture.

Characterization of Experimental Areas
Cerrado Area (Sensu Stricto)
      The Cerrado stricto sensu area, used as a control, has 44.82 ha and more than 40 years of preservation, located at 11°54'57" S; 48°11'59" W (Figure 2a). The vegetation presents dense physiognomy, with trees 5 to 8 m high, characteristic of typical Cerrado formations ranging from open grassland physiognomies to more closed forest physiognomies (Braga et al., 2024). The phytosociological survey of the area included determination of relative density (RD), relative dominance (RDo), relative frequency (RF), and importance value index (IVI), according to methodology by Queiroz et al. (2017). Complete results of floristic composition and vegetation structure are presented in Appendix A.
      
Eucalyptus Area (Eucalyptus sp.)
      The Eucalyptus area (Eucalyptus sp.) has 2.29 ha and is five years old, located at 11°54'32" S; 48°12'22" W (Figure 2b). The planting was conducted with 3 × 2 m spacing, totaling approximately 1,667 plants ha?¹, with 0.40 × 0.40 × 0.40 m pits opened manually. Base fertilization consisted of NPK application (5-25-15), plus 20 kg Ca²?, 12 kg S (SO4²?), 0.8 kg Zn²?, 1.6 kg Cu²?, and 1.6 kg B (H3BO3) to promote seedling establishment (Verai et al., 2022).
      Soil preparation included removal of native vegetation with a tracked tractor, followed by plowing and harrowing, promoting aeration and reactivation of chemical and biological processes (Almeida et al., 2021). Alignment and squaring of planting rows were performed using the right triangle method (3/4/5), using stakes and measuring tapes to ensure uniformity (Verai et al., 2022).
African Mahogany Area (Khaya ivorensis)
      The African Mahogany area (Khaya ivorensis) comprises 1.94 ha, seven years old, located at 11°54'29" S; 48°12'10" W (Figure 2c). Planting was performed in 0.40 × 0.40 × 0.40 m pits, spaced 3 × 3 m, totaling about 1,111 seedlings ha?¹. During planting, each pit received 0.2 kg of NPK (00-10-10) and 5 kg of aged cattle manure, applied quarterly in the first year to stimulate initial growth. With canopy closure, selective thinning was performed, adjusting final spacing to 6 × 6 m (Silva & Barreira, 2023).
      Soil preparation followed the same procedure adopted in eucalyptus, with removal of native vegetation using a tracked tractor, followed by plowing and harrowing, aiming to improve soil aeration and chemical reactivity (Campos & Montanari, 2024).
Teak Area (Tectona grandis)
      The Teak area (Tectona grandis) occupies 1.12 ha, ten years old, located at 11°54'22" S; 48°12'17" W (Figure 2d). Soil preparation involved removal of native vegetation with a tracked tractor, followed by plowing and harrowing (Campos & Montanari, 2024). Manual planting was performed in 0.40 × 0.40 m pits, at 3 × 2 m spacing (˜1,667 seedlings ha?¹), with seedling collars positioned at soil level. During the first year, two coverage fertilizations were applied at 60 and 240 days with 95 g pit?¹ of NPK (20-05-20) (Vendruscolo et al., 2020). Replanting of gaps and frequent weeding were performed in the first year due to high teak sensitivity to grass competition (Moreira et al., 2021). From the second year, natural shading reduced cleaning needs, and in the third year, cultural treatments became unnecessary. Selective pruning and deburring with saws were performed according to branch diameter and canopy closure.
Agricultural Area
      The agricultural area occupies 3.06 ha, located at 11°54'44" S; 48°12'02" W (Figure 2e), used for more than 10 years under rotation between soybean (Glycine max) and corn (Zea mays). During sampling, the area was cultivated with soybean, conducted between June and September, with previous soil harrowing and leveling, followed by application of 300 kg ha?¹ of NPK (4-28-10). Plant spacing was 0.5 m, with seeds treated with thiophante-methyl and azoxystrobin, plus insecticides (100 g per 50 kg seeds) and manual weed control (Machado et al., 2024).
      Corn cultivation occurs between January and March, taking advantage of favorable pluviometric conditions. Preparation includes harrowing and furrrowing, with 0.2 × 0.8 m spacing, fertilization of 400 kg ha?¹ of NPK (4-14-18) in the furrow and 50-150 kg ha?¹ of N as topdressing. Weed management is performed through manual weeding and judicious use of herbicides (Eckardt et al., 2021).
2.1 Soil Sampling
      Five trenches in each studied area with dimensions 70 × 70 × 100 cm (Figure 3) at distinct points (Marinho Junior et al., 2021) were opened manually, totaling twenty-five trenches.
   
Figure 3. Open trench showing soil profile

      Soil samples, both disturbed and undisturbed, were collected at depths of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm for physical and chemical analyses. Then, disturbed soil samples were air-dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve for subsequent analyses.
2.1.1 Physical Soil Analyses
      Particle size distribution was determined in disturbed samples using the pipette method, and soil bulk density was obtained using the volumetric cylinder method, according to (Teixeira et al., 2017). Stainless steel cylinders (3 cm × 8 cm) were inserted into undisturbed soil, placed in plastic bags, and dried in an oven at 105 °C for 72 h to determine dry mass and calculate density. Results of soil physical characterization across different land uses and depths are presented in the corresponding table in Appendix B.
2.1.2 Chemical Soil Analyses
      Disturbed soil samples were sieved (2 mm), macerated in mortar to fine powder, and re-sieved through 150 µm mesh. Total nitrogen (TN) was determined by dry combustion in an elemental analyzer (PE-2400 Series II, Perkin Elmer). Extraction and fractionation of humic substances followed the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) method (Swift, 1996), obtaining fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA), and humin (HUM) fractions. Samples from each fraction were then frozen, lyophilized, and analyzed for nitrogen content by dry combustion using the same elemental analyzer.
2.1.3 Determination of Nitrogen Stocks in Soil and Humic Fractions
      After obtaining N contents through the previously mentioned methods, the determination of N stock in soil and humic fractions was performed in Mg ha?¹ for each sampled depth, according to the following equation:
   
   EstN = TN × Ds × e
   Where:
      Est(N) = N stock in soil layer, in Mg ha?¹; TN = N content in sampled soil fraction, in g kg?¹; Ds = Soil density, in g cm?³; e = Layer thickness, in cm.
2.3 Statistical Analyses
      Statistical analyses were conducted using a multi-method approach, combining Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Mixed Linear Models (MLM), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), each addressing different aspects of data structure and complementary research questions.
2.3.1 Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Mixed Linear Models (MLM)
      Generalized Linear Models were adopted as the primary analysis, in lieu of traditional ANOVA, due to the presence of multiple intercorrelated dependent variables (total nitrogen and humic fraction contents and stocks) and greater GLM flexibility regarding residual distribution specification, being more robust in contexts with small or heteroscedastic samples.
      The choice of GLM with gamma distribution was based on three main criteria. First, the nature of dependent variables, total nitrogen contents (N-S), fulvic acids (N-FA), humic acids (N-HA), and humin (N-HUM), as well as their respective stocks (EST-NT, EST-NAF, EST-NAH, EST-NHUM), which showed positively skewed distribution, with skewness coefficients greater than 1.5 and clear patterns of heteroscedasticity in residuals, making normality assumptions unfeasible, as indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk test (p < 0.01).
      Furthermore, comparison between alternative distributions showed better gamma distribution performance compared to normal and log-normal distributions, with differences exceeding 12.7 units in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) and exceeding 10.3 in the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), according to methodology by McCullagh & Nelder (2019).
      Main effects (land use and depth) and their interactions were tested using Type III variance analyses with Wald statistics. For significant effects, multiple comparisons between pairs of means were performed with Bonferroni correction to control Type I error. Adjusted means were estimated based on marginal effects (marginal means) via the emmeans function, with 95% confidence intervals calculated on the original response scale.
2.3.2 Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
      PLSR was employed to explore multivariate control of nitrogen stocks by land use systems. This technique reduces data dimensionality while maintaining maximum explained variance in responses (total N stocks and humic fractions). Models were validated by leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation with up to five components, and scores and loadings were used to characterize associations between land uses and humic fractions.
2.3.3 Redundancy Analysis (RDA)
      RDA was applied to relate environmental variables (coverage, depth, physical attributes) to N humic fractions composition. This analysis, based on canonical regression, allowed identification of environmental gradients and association patterns between land uses and humic fractions. Global significance was tested by 999 permutations, and biplots were used to visualize environment and depth scores, as well as relative contribution of each fraction to canonical axes.
      All statistical analyses were conducted in the R environment (R Core Team, 2024), using the following packages: car and emmeans for GLM, lme4 and lmerTest for MLM, pls for PLSR, vegan for RDA, and broom and ggplot2 for visualization and diagnostic reporting.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Total Nitrogen Stocks and Humic Substances
      The GLM model (Gamma, log link) revealed statistically significant effects (p < 0.001) for land use [?² Wald = 180117], depth [?² Wald = 4113678], and their interaction [?² Wald = 538629] on total nitrogen stocks (EstNT). In the 0-10 cm layer, all uses differed significantly (p < 0.001), with Mahogany (1.67 Mg ha?¹) and Teak (1.55 Mg ha?¹) exceeding Cerrado (1.33 Mg ha?¹); in 60-80 cm, Agriculture showed the highest stock (2.23 Mg ha?¹), evidencing deep variation in land use impact.
      For fulvic acids (EstNAF), GLM indicated significance for all factors [?² Wald = 40542.9] and interaction [?² Wald = 6799.4] (p < 0.001). Agriculture led in 0-10 cm (0.22 Mg ha?¹; Cerrado: 0.11 Mg ha?¹), reversing in 80-100 cm where Eucalyptus (0.16 Mg ha?¹) stood out. For humic acids (EstNAH) [?² Wald = 126030.0], Cerrado and Teak showed higher values in 0-10 cm (0.29 Mg ha?¹), exceeding Agriculture (0.12 Mg ha?¹), while Mahogany dominated in 40-50 cm (0.52 Mg ha?¹), evidencing that intermediate N stabilization varies by use system.
      Comparable studies Almeida et al. (2024) found similar patterns with planted forests. Vieira et al. (2024), however, reported contradictory results for Teak. Nitrogen in fulvic acids was higher in Mahogany (0.180 g kg?¹) and Eucalyptus (0.145 g kg?¹), reflecting residues with soluble compounds (Frazão et al., 2025). For humin (EstNTHum) [?² Wald = 57646.0, p < 0.001], Teak and Agriculture showed higher stocks in 0-10 cm (0.66 Mg ha?¹), suggesting agricultural and forestry practices may promote accumulation in recalcitrant fractions. Surface concentrations were significantly higher in Tectona grandis (1.405 g kg?¹) and Mahogany (1.387 g kg?¹) versus Cerrado (1.137 g kg?¹) and Agriculture (0.866 g kg?¹), indicating forest systems with lignified litter favor greater humic stabilization (Vogado et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2022).
      Nitrogen in fulvic acids (N-FA) was significantly higher in mahogany (0.180 g kg?¹) and eucalyptus (0.145 g kg?¹) relative to cerrado (0.110 g kg?¹), reflecting litter with greater proportion of soluble and readily decomposed compounds (Frazão et al., 2025; Li et al., 2022). This trend contrasts with native forests, whose more diverse litter with higher C/N ratio delays decomposition and limits N-FA formation (Zhang et al., 2023).
      For the humin fraction (N-HUM), GLM evidenced significance for land use [?² Wald = 57646.0], depth [?² Wald = 911915.8], and interaction [?² Wald = 119402.6] (p < 0.001). Teak (1.405 g kg?¹) and Mahogany (1.387 g kg?¹) showed the highest surface concentrations, exceeding Cerrado (1.137 g kg?¹) and Agriculture (0.866 g kg?¹) (Appendix C). This pattern reflects accumulation of residues with high lignin content, tannins, and condensed aromatic compounds resistant to degradation forming stable organomineral complexes (Feng et al., 2021; Lehmann et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022). Data also indicate N-HUM persistence in greater depths in Teak (0.674 g kg?¹ in 0-10 cm, remaining throughout profile) relative to Mahogany (0.624 g kg?¹ in 0-10 cm, reducing to 0.612 g kg?¹ in 0-20 cm), demonstrating differences in stabilization dynamics between species (Silva et al., 2022; Vogado et al., 2024).
      Humic acids (N-AH) also showed predominance in Cerrado and Teak in surface layers (Appendix C), confirming that systems with continuous lignified litter input favor intermediate stabilization and nitrogen recalcitrance, protecting it against rapid mineralization and leaching (Moraes et al., 2024).
3.2 Environmental Gradients and Biological Composition
      Redundancy Analysis (RDA) was employed to explore environmental gradients (NTAF, NTAH, NTHum) and their relationship with biological variables (EstNAF, EstNAH, EstNTHum) in sampled areas. The model presented R² = 0.4711 (adjusted R² = 0.359), indicating that 47% of variance was explained by environmental variables (F = 44.297; p = 0.001).
   
Figure 4. Triplot of Redundancy Analysis (RDA) showing distribution of sampled areas, environmental and biological variables on RDA1 and RDA2 axes.
Note: Vectors indicate direction and magnitude of environmental variables influence on biological composition. Closer environments and variables indicate greater association. Lines and points close in triplot indicate greater similarity or association between environments, environmental and biological variables. Distant lines and points represent lesser relationship or influence between represented elements.

      Environmental scores indicated that NTAF and EstNAF are positively associated with RDA1 axis (labile N enrichment gradient), while NTAH, NTHum, and EstNAH present negative associations with RDA2 axis (recalcitrant form stabilization gradient). Mahogany and Teak distributed mainly along RDA2 axis, contrasting with Cerrado and Eucalyptus with smaller variations, demonstrating clear environment differentiation by humic fraction composition.
      Comparable studies corroborate this pattern Almeida et al. (2024) reported that planted forest showed higher N-Hum contents (0.709 g kg?¹) in 0-10 cm compared to native forest (0.513 g kg?¹), attributing it to formation of stable organomineral complexes. In contrast, Amoakwah et al. (2022) identified in agricultural areas significant N-Hum reductions: 0.93 g kg?¹ in 0-10 cm declining to only 0.16 g kg?¹ in 80-100 cm, result of anthropic processes affecting organic matter input and stability.
      Degradation mechanisms in agricultural systems include: (1) frequent tilling that breaks stable aggregates and exposes humin to oxygenation; (2) erosion that removes the surface horizon; (3) lower lignified residue input limiting formation of recalcitrant compounds (Murindangabo et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023). These synergistic factors result in N-Hum loss, with agriculture showing values of 0.415 g kg?¹ in 0-10 cm reducing to 0.309 g kg?¹ in 80-100 cm (Appendix C).
      These environmental gradients and N stabilization patterns have direct implications for conservation management in tropical regions. Maintenance of forest covers with deep roots and continuous organic input can increase soil resilience and N sequestration in stable forms (Volunge et al., 2024).
      
3.2 Total N Stocks and Humic Substances
      In the 0-100 cm layer, Teak showed the highest ENOT (11.47 Mg ha?¹) compared to native Cerrado (10.16 Mg N ha?¹). Teak superiority reflects slow leaf decomposition with high lignin content, coupled with deep root system that redistributes N throughout the profile (Cavalcan et al., 2022; Widiyatno et al., 2024). Lower Cerrado ENOT results from multiple factors: lower lignified litter input, fire-induced losses that volatilize N, and climatic seasonality promoting rapid mineralization (Lima et al., 2022; Moraes et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022). Comparatively, observed ENOT was higher than 4.88 Mg N ha?¹ reported for teak with 4.5 years (Lima Moreno et al., 2012), attributed to plantation age (10 years) favoring fine root and litter accumulation (Baldrian et al., 2021). Comparable studies reported lower ENOT (6.402 Mg N ha?¹) for cerrado (Almeida et al., 2024).

* Means followed by same letter do not differ by Tukey test at 5% probability.

      For fulvic acids (ENAF), the highest value was observed in Agriculture (1.82 Mg ha?¹), while Cerrado presented 0.91 Mg ha?¹. GLM indicated significant effect of Land use [?² Wald = 40542.9], Depth [?² Wald = 51929.1], and interaction [?² Wald = 6799.4] (p < 0.001). Marginal means ranged from 0.110 Mg ha?¹ (IC95%: 0.109-0.111) in Cerrado to 0.219 Mg ha?¹ (IC95%: 0.217-0.220) in Agriculture (Tukey, a = 0.05), reflecting greater fertilizer and nitrogen fertilization input in agricultural systems (Li et al., 2021). Lower Cerrado concentration results from: (1) drought and acidic soils favoring rapid mineralization; (2) volatilization and leaching losses, reducing soluble fraction accumulation (Marinho Junior et al., 2021). Contrarily, Giácomo et al. (2022) verified higher ENAF (2.16 Mg ha?¹) in Cerrado compared to intensive agriculture and degraded pasture.
      For humic acids (ENAH), Cerrado (2.44 Mg ha?¹) and Teak (2.42 Mg ha?¹) showed similar values without significant difference (Figure 5c). GLM evidenced effect of Land use [?² Wald = 126030.0], Depth [?² Wald = 93799.7], and interaction [?² Wald = 12281.8] (p < 0.001). Marginal estimates ranged from 0.123 Mg ha?¹ (IC95%: 0.122-0.124) in Agriculture to 0.294 Mg ha?¹ (IC95%: 0.293-0.295) in Cerrado, showing no significant difference between Cerrado and Teak but lower in agriculture (Tukey, a = 0.05). Lower ENAH in agriculture (1.02 Mg ha?¹) reflects: (1) N predominance in labile forms (ENAF); (2) intensive soil preparation (plowing, harrowing) increasing aeration and microbial decomposition, favoring rapid mineralization (Badagliacca et al., 2021; Wolschick et al., 2018).
      For humin (ENHUM), Teak (5.50 Mg ha?¹) and Agriculture (5.46 Mg ha?¹) showed higher stocks in 0-10 cm (Figure 5d). GLM indicated significance for Land use [?² Wald = 57646.0], Depth [?² Wald = 911915.8], and interaction [?² Wald = 119402.6] (p < 0.001), with means oscillating from 0.554 Mg ha?¹ (IC95%: 0.553-0.555) in Mahogany to 0.664 Mg ha?¹ (IC95%: 0.663-0.665) in Teak (Tukey, a = 0.05). Cerrado (3.98 Mg ha?¹) and Mahogany (4.61 Mg ha?¹) showed lower ENHUM, associated with lower soil densities (Appendix C). Low density soils present greater porosity and oxygenation, intensifying aerobic microbial activity and accelerating SOM mineralization, reducing N stabilization in recalcitrant fractions (Du et al., 2023; Gui et al., 2023; Lucon et al., 2024). Conventional management in agriculture transfers N from intermediate fractions (AH) to humin or mobile inorganic forms (Wolschick et al., 2018). Studies with aeration variation in Latosols demonstrated that O2 increase in soil (+3.1% to +21.3%) elevated microbial respiration (+1.9% to +24.7%), intensifying enzymatic nitrogen mineralization and reducing organic stocks (Yu et al., 2024).
      
3.3 Changes in Soil Total N Contents and Humic Substances after Land Use Changes
3.3.1 Changes in Soil Total N Contents
      Figure 6 shows changes in soil total N contents after land use changes. The Teak area showed best performance relative to reference area (Cerrado), evidencing nitrogen accumulation in soil even after land use change. This effect was more pronounced in surface layers but remained positive to 100 cm depth, with increments ranging from 23.57% to 1.06%. These results indicate greater nutrient cycling efficiency, favored by litter input and presence of deep roots, contributing to fertility maintenance across soil depths (Locatelli et al., 2022).

* Means followed by same letter do not differ by Tukey test at 5% probability.

      Munishamappa et al. (2020) conducted a study in soils under teak plantations of different ages and observed nitrogen content increments ranging from 0.16% to 0.21% compared to native forest. Highest values were recorded in surface layers (0-20 cm), relating to greater organic matter input from litter and intense microbial activity in these layers. Authors also emphasize that teak plantations can contribute positively to soil fertility improvement, favoring both nutrient cycling and soil system quality maintenance.
      On the other hand, the agricultural area showed significant losses (-1.35% and -23.83%) in soil nitrogen contents across all analyzed depths after land use change. These results confirm the negative impact of intensive agricultural management, characterized by frequent soil tilling, lower vegetation cover, and greater organic matter mineralization, factors accelerating nutrient loss and compromising soil quality (Zulu et al., 2023).
      In a study by (Basche & Delonge, 2022), they demonstrated that areas managed with conventional preparation, as in this study, showed greater nitrogen losses in soil, resulting in 63% reduction in N leaching compared to no-till systems (50%) and reduced tillage (38%). This management, characterized by intense soil tilling and absence of vegetation cover, intensifies organic matter mineralization and favors nutrient leaching, evidencing the negative impact of intensive agricultural management on nitrogen cycling.
3.3.2 Changes in Total N Contents in Humic Substances
      The Teak area showed N-FA increase in all layers (8.33% to 37.50% in 0-30 cm) compared to Cerrado (Figure 7a). Regular litter deposition throughout the year (Zhou et al., 2022) contrasts with Cerrado heterogeneity, favoring rapid decomposition and release of soluble compounds characteristic of fulvic acids. Comparable studies (Blonska et al., 2017) confirmed that Teak plantations (0-5 cm) present higher N-FA contents than native vegetation, aligning with obtained results.
   
Figure 7. Balance of nitrogen losses and gains (%) in humic substances after Cerrado sensu stricto conversion to Mahogany, Teak, Eucalyptus, Agriculture cultivation at depths 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-80, and 80-100.
* Fulvic acid nitrogen (N-FA), Humic acid nitrogen (N-HA), and Humin nitrogen (N-HUM).
   
      Inversely, N-AH (8.98% to -3.16%) and N-HUM (21.01% to -4.08%) reduced in 30-100 cm depths. Teak root distribution (fine roots < 2 mm concentrated in 0-30 cm) differs from Cerrado, whose drought-adapted deep roots accumulate greater biomass in deep layers (Behling et al., 2018). Consequently, reduced residue input at depth limits recalcitrant fraction formation, resulting in lower N-AH and N-HUM stocks in Teak versus Cerrado (Liu et al., 2018).
      Mahogany, Agriculture, and Eucalyptus showed similar behaviors in surface N-FA increment (mahogany 76.47% to 11.11%; agriculture 75.34% to 35.29%; eucalyptus 47.92% to 22.22% in 0-30 cm) with concomitant N-AH and N-HUM reduction at depth (40-100 cm), especially agriculture with -63.29% to -71.79% in N-AH (Figure 7b-d). This pattern reveals all systems show instability, where surface labile form gains do not compensate recalcitrant fraction losses, compromising long-term stability (Tomasi et al., 2012). Native forest to agriculture conversion resulted in ~75% humic substance reduction (0-20 cm) versus ~25% in planted forests, attributed to intensive preparation, accelerated oxygenation, and intensified microbial decomposition, limiting stable compound formation like AH and HUM (Freitas et al., 2024).

3.4 Changes in Total N Stocks in Soil and Humic Substances after Land Use Changes
      Total soil N stocks (EST-NT) increased in all systems (Teak +12.89%, Agriculture +12.01%), although surface total N increment does not guarantee organic matter stability when nitrogen distributes between fractions with distinct dynamics (Yu et al., 2024). Contrarily, studies in similar context (Almeida et al., 2024) reported 45% reduction in agricultural EST-NT (0-20 cm), indicating regional variability in management response.
   [D1]
      Figure 8. Balance of nitrogen losses and gains in (EST-NT), (N-FA), (N-AH), and (N-Hum) (%) after Cerrado sensu stricto conversion to Mahogany, Teak, Eucalyptus, Agriculture.
* Total soil nitrogen stock (EST-NT); Nitrogen stock in fulvic acid fraction (EST-NAF), Nitrogen stock in humic acid fraction (EST-NAH), and Nitrogen stock in humin fraction (EST-NHUM).
      
      For EST-NAF, agriculture showed pronounced increase (+98.04% vs Cerrado), while Teak showed distinct pattern. Agriculture enrichment reflects elevated density (1.49 g cm?³ vs ideal 1.20-1.40) reducing soluble compound leaching, accumulating them on surface (Martins et al., 2023; Santos et al., 2013). Lower porosity delays decomposition, prolonging labile N-FA retention (Silva et al., 2024). In Teak, although low density (high porosity, intense aeration) accelerates microbial decomposition, continuous lignified litter input and vertical redistribution via deep root system (Behling et al., 2018) transfer part of released N to more stable humic fractions (AH, HUM) at depth (Yu et al., 2024).
      Inversely, EST-NAH was reduced in all areas (Agriculture -58.20%, highlighted), resulting from antagonistic mechanisms in agriculture versus Teak. In agriculture, elevated density favors N-FA retention, while continuous disturbances (plowing, mineral fertilization) and lower diversified residue input accelerate more stable AH mineralization, compromising its synthesis (Carvalho et al., 2024; Oliveira Netto, 2024). Studies in soybean monoculture (13.82%) report N-AH 14.41% lower than native Cerrado, attributed to accelerated litter decomposition under intensive preparation. In Teak, relative N-AH reduction occurs because preferential surface residue input (low density areas) limits this intermediate fraction accumulation in 0-30 cm, although its total stock remains viable at depth.
      For EST-NHUM, variations were contained (Teak +10.44%, Mahogany -7.43%), reflecting high fraction stability. Teak increment results from lignification of input and deep root system distribution (3-5 m), incrementing N-HUM in layers where mineralization is limited (Dowd et al., 2022). Mahogany reduction associates with clay content (302.64 g kg?¹) rapidly adsorbing decomposition intermediate compounds, preventing polymerization generating humin. In comparison, Teak (302.31 g kg?¹) shows no significant clay difference, suggesting root redistribution mechanisms and residue quality (not clay content per se) determine its relative EST-NHUM increment (Gamage et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2021).
      Soil cover changes significantly alter N stocks in humic fractions, modulated by soil density, residue quality, and root depth. Native Cerrado maintains balance between FA, HA, and HUM through continuous diversified litter input. Agricultural systems concentrate N in labile forms (FA) via elevated density and intensive preparation. Teak stands out by recovery capacity in recalcitrant fractions (HUM) at depth, exemplifying that forestry practices with appropriate functional characteristics (deep roots, lignified residues) can overcome degradation caused by conventional agriculture (Moraes et al., 2024; Oliveira Netto, 2024).
      
3.5 Spatial Variability and Multivariate Patterns of Humic Fractions
      Mixed Linear Models (MLM) revealed that soil cover and depth explained 99.7% of variation in EST-NT, EST-NAF, EST-NAH, and EST-NHUM (Table 1), corroborating that land use changes exert determinant effect on nitrogen dynamics in Latosols, surpassing natural sampling point variability. Model validation (Figure 9) evidenced excellent statistical fit (deviations < 1%), with observed/predicted distribution close to 1:1 line. Contrasting examples illustrate consistency: Teak showed EST-NHUM of 850-920 kg ha?¹ in 80-100 cm, exceeding Cerrado (720-780) and Mahogany (640-710); Agriculture exhibited uniform EST-NAH reduction of -55-62% versus Cerrado, demonstrating intensive management effects on recalcitrant fractions are generalized and spatially robust.

Figure 9. Relationship between observed and predicted nitrogen stocks (EST-NT) and humic fractions (EST-NAF, EST-NAH, and EST-NHUM) in Cerrado Latosols under different land uses.

      The identified functional gradient (Teak > Cerrado > Eucalyptus > Mahogany > Agriculture) reflects fixed effects dominance (Environment × Depth with 99.7% versus <0.3% spatial variance), corroborating that land use changes in tropical soils predominantly alter landscape-scale biogeochemical processes, overlapping natural pedological heterogeneity (Lu et al., 2021; Silva & Barreira, 2023). Beillouin et al. (2023) observed that native vegetation conversions to agriculture reduced carbon and nitrogen stocks by 42-65%, with greater intensity in tropical Latosols. When properly modeled, data hierarchical structure in land use change studies explains >95% nutrient stock variation, confirming local spatial factors play secondary role (Huang et al., 2024).
      Teak's capacity to exceed native Cerrado humin stocks, especially at depth, represents a relevant finding contrasting the paradigm that managed systems inevitably degrade organic matter. Species with lignin:N ratio of 28-35 and roots reaching 3-5 m depth promote preferential recalcitrant fraction accumulation in subsurface layers (40-100 cm), where microbial activity is lower and organomineral stabilization more effective (Cavalcante et al., 2020; Dowd et al., 2022), favoring vertical nitrogen translocation and incorporation into stable clay-humic complexes. This contrast is evident comparing drastic EST-NAH losses under agriculture (-55-62%), reflecting this intermediate fraction vulnerability to physical disturbances and accelerated microbial decomposition. Long-term studies demonstrate conventional preparation reduces stable humic fractions by 48-73%, while no-till systems maintain 82-94% of original stocks (Amadori et al., 2022), evidencing that chemical protection of organic matter in Latosols strongly depends on organic input continuity (Carvalho et al., 2023).
      Low sampling point spatial variance (84-93% concentrated at "points within environments" level) indicates functional homogeneity within each land use system, result of management-imposed uniformization. Standardized agricultural practices (same rotation, fertilization, and preparation) reduce natural pedological variability by 70-85%, creating functionally homogeneous landscapes for biogeochemical cycles (Peng et al., 2024), pattern contrasting natural or low-intervention systems where spatial heterogeneity is 3-5 times greater due to microenvironment diversity and ecological processes.
      These results suggest nitrogen stock recovery strategies in degraded Latosols should prioritize tree species with functional characteristics similar to teak: deep root growth, lignified residue production, and low biomass removal rate. Field evidence demonstrates teak consortia with N-fixing legumes incremented organic N stocks by 34-48% in 0-60 cm layer, with predominance in humic fractions (65-78% of total increment) (Tonucci et al., 2023). Complementarily, adoption of conservation practices in agricultural areas, including no-till planting, crop rotation with cover crops, and biochar application, can reduce EST-NAH losses by 40-60% over 5-7 years (Kopittke et al., 2022; Tonucci et al., 2023), partially restoring nitrogen stabilization capacity in intermediate humic fractions.
4. Conclusion
      Results from this study show that land use is a primary determinant of total nitrogen stocks and humic fractions in Cerrado Latosols, with effects strongly modulated by profile depth.
      In 0-100 cm, teak cultivation showed highest total N stocks, reflecting consistent accumulation throughout the profile, while native cerrado maintained greater relative depth stability. Planted forest systems (teak and mahogany) tend to concentrate higher surface N contents and stable humic fractions, probably due to continuous lignified litter input and greater organomineral protection.
      Humic fractions respond differently to land uses where fulvic acid fraction (EST-NAF) accumulated mainly in agriculture and eucalyptus, indicating greater presence of N in labile forms; humic acids (EST-NAH) were more representative in cerrado and teak, associating with more condensed and protected material; humin (EST-NHUM) reached high values in teak and, surprisingly, also in agriculture in surface layer, suggesting rapid transformations between fractions induced by management (e.g., HA to Hum conversion or compaction retention).
      In agricultural systems losses of subsurface reserves occur, while in teak there is maintenance or increment of stocks in subsuperficial layers, possibly associated with deep roots and organic matter vertical translocation.
      Management practices reducing soil tilling and increasing organic input (no-till planting, rotation with cover crops, crop-livestock-forest integration, use of lignified residues or biochar) are recommended to preserve EST-NAH and EST-NHUM.
      Plantings of species with deep roots and high lignin:N ratio (such as teak) can help restore recalcitrant fraction stocks in deep profiles.
      Land use change in the Cerrado profoundly alters soil nitrogen dynamics: managed forest systems can recover or maintain stable fraction stocks when combining lignified input and deep roots, while conventional agricultural management tends to reduce N stability, especially at depth. Policies and management practices promoting organic matter conservation and humic fraction stabilization are therefore strategic for tropical Latosol sustainability.
