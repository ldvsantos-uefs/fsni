ABSTRACT - The replacement of native vegetation promotes changes in quality the soil organic matter (SOM) and nitrogen (N), one of its main constituents. This study aimed to evaluate the N levels and stocks in humic substances (HS) under different uses (Cerrado sensu stricto, eucalyptus, agriculture, pasture) in plinthosols in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. Therefore, the soil samples were collected and determined the contents and stocks of total N in humic substances (FA - Fulvic Acid, HA - Humic Acid and Hum - Humin) by dry combustion, the means being compared using the Tukey test at 5% probability. The eucalyptus area presented the highest levels and significant average stocks of N in humic fractions, demonstrating the benefits of this system for the soil. The agriculture area promoted an increase in N-FA and N-Hum levels and stocks, but reduced N-HA, while the Pasture reduced the levels and stocks of N-FA and N-Hum, keeping N-HA stable. The losses observed in these systems indicated that the SOM was negatively altered, which suggests the need for adaptations in the way soil is used and managed.

INTRODUCTION
    The intensification of the demand for food, associated with the unregulated exploitation of natural resources, has imposed severe pressure on natural ecosystems, promoting changes in the land cover and use and contributing to the degradation of the soil structure and functionality (Sharma et al., 2020).
    Conventional agricultural practices, such as intensive soil tillage and inefficient input management, have been associated with soil organic matter (SOM) degradation, negatively affecting the soil resilience and long-term sustainability (Pittarello et al., 2021). Recent evidence indicates that intensive land use, especially in agricultural and pasture areas, causes negative changes in the levels and stocks of nitrogen associated with humic substances - fundamental fractions of SOM -, resulting in losses of FA-N (fulvic acid) and Hum-N (humin), particularly in the surface layers of the soil (Kou et al., 2022; Kulikowska & Bernat, 2022).
    In well-preserved native ecosystems, such as tropical forests and Cerrado areas, N remains in dynamic equilibrium with the fluxes of biomass addition and decomposition, especially through its humic fractions fulvic acid (N-FA), humic acid (N-HA) and humin (N-Hum) that control the mechanisms of retention, release and stability of the nutrient (Leizeaga et al., 2022; Shah et al., 2020).
    Although total nitrogen (N-T) is widely used as an indicator in fertility studies, its high variability makes it difficult to detect short-term changes. The analysis of humic fractions of SOM offers a more refined and sensitive approach to detect early changes in soil conservation status, compared to traditional methods based only on total N or total organic C (Bingham & Cotrufo, 2016). 
    Considering the representativeness and the expansion of the agricultural activity in Brazil, which has driven the conversion of natural areas, especially in the Cerrado biome, into agricultural and livestock use systems, it is essential to investigate the impacts of these transformations on soil attributes. This need is even more pressing in the northern region of the country, where there are significant gaps in knowledge about Plinthosols, a class of sensitive soils that is often neglected in the scientific literature.
    Therefore, this study aimed evaluate the N levels and stocks in humic substances (HS) under different uses (Cerrado sensu stricto, eucalyptus, agriculture, pasture) in plinthosols in the state of Tocantins, Brazil.




MATERIAL AND METHODS

Stuudy area

     The study was carried out at the experimental farm of the Federal University of Tocantins, in the municipality of Gurupi, located in the south of the state of Tocantins, Brazil, at the central geographic coordinates 11º 46' 25" S and 49º 02' 54" W (Figure 1).

     The climate of the region, according to the Thornthwaite and Mather method, is humid subhumid, with moderate water deficiency in winter (C2wA 'a'), with an average annual temperature of 27ºC and average annual precipitation of 1,500 mm (SEPLAN, 2017). The soil of the areas were classified as Plinthosol (SANTOS et al., 2018), with gently undulating relief and average slope of 3.2%. The study areas, according to the characteristics presented in Table 1 below.

Study areasCharacteristicsNative Forest - CER
(reference area)Area of ??22.82 ha, occupied by Cerrado sensu stricto and over 60 years old. The main forest species existing in the area in relation to the absolute dominance parameter were Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) Marchand, Tapirira guianensis Aubl., Magonia pubescens A.St.-Hil., Myrcia splendens (Sw.) DC., Qualea multiflora Mart. and Antonia ovata Pohl.Eucalyptus - EUCArea of ??0.65 ha, occupied by 11 years old Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake. It planted after removing Cerrado sensu stricto using a crawler tractor with a front blade attached, followed by plowing and harrowing of the soil. The eucalyptus seedlings were planted in holes measuring 40 x 40 x 40 cm, opened using manual diggers at a spacing of 3.0 x 2.0 m. Fertilization per hole was 100 g of simple superphosphate placed at the bottom of the hole, in addition to the addition of 150 g of NPK in the formulation 5-25-15.Nature Pasture - PASArea of ??11.25 ha, occupied by pasture over 40 years old, with a predominance of Andropogon sp. grass, in addition to other species such as Paspalum notatum Flügge, Eragrostis bahiensis Schrad, Axonopus affinis Chase, Bothriochloa laguroides (DC.) Herter, Schizachyrium microstachyum (Desv. ex Ham) Roseng, Paspalum dilatatum Poir., Sporobolus indicus P.Beauv., Rhynchospora sp., Andropogon ternatus. (Spreng.), Panpalumis sp. Agriculture - AGRArea of ??0.95 ha, occupied by 6 years with corn (Zea mays L.). It planted after removing Cerrado sensu stricto., the soil prepared with a leveling harrow and disc plow and weeds controlled by manual weeding associated with the use of total action herbicides such as Glyphosate, when necessary. Planting occurred once a year, adopting an average spacing of 0.20 x 0.80 m. Sowing was carried out with a manual planter-fertilizer and fertilization with N in the form of ammonium sulfate (45% N), phosphorus in the form of triple superphosphate (42% P2O5) and potassium in the form of potassium chloride (58% K2O), corresponding to 120, 170 and 140 kg ha-1, respectively of N, P and K, with N being applied 50% at 25 days and 50% at 45 days after sowing. Harvests were carried out manually, with crop residues remaining on the soil (MELO et al., 2017).
Soil sampling
    For the soil sampling, six 70 x 70 cm trenches measuring 50 cm deep and measuring 70 x 70 cm were dug in each study area. The soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 cm.

Soil physical characterization
    The distribution of soil particle sizes at depths was performed on disturbed samples using the pipette method (Teixeira et al., 2017), and undeformed samples were subjected to soil density analysis. The averages of the areas at the depths are presented in Table 2.

Determination of total nitrogen in humic substances
    To perform the chemical analyses, the deformed soil samples were subjected to chemical fractionation, based on the differential solubility in alkaline and acidic solutions (Swift, 1996), obtaining the fractions corresponding to fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA) and humin (Hum). Subsequently, the samples of each fraction were frozen and lyophilized to determine the N content in each humic fraction by dry combustion in an elemental analyzer (Model PE-2400 Series II Perkin Elmer). 
    Based on the N contents obtained previously, the total N stock and each humic fraction in Mg ha-1 were determined at each sampling depth using Equation 1.
    
    EstN=TN * Ds * and (1)
    Where:
    EstN = N stock in the soil layer, in Mg ha-1;
    TN = N content in the sampled soil fraction, in g kg-1;
    Ds = Soil density, in g cm-3;
    e = layer thickness, in cm.
    
    The total N stock in each humic fraction at a depth of 0 to 0.50 m was the result of the sum of the values ??obtained in each sampled layer.
    The parameters evaluated were initially subjected to the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and verification of homogeneity of variances using the Levene test. When the premises were met, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by the Tukey test to compare the means at a 5% significance level, with the aid of the SPSS V.25 software (SPSS Corp, 2017).
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as an exploratory multivariate statistical tool to identify latent patterns and reduce the dimensionality of data related to nitrogen stocks in humic fractions distributed at different soil depths. The data were organized into a standardized correlation matrix (Z-score), and component retention was based on Kaiser's rule (eigenvalues ??> 1), complemented by the screen plot analysis. Varimax orthogonal rotation was used to improve the factor interpretation. 
    The factor loadings of the retained components were interpreted according to the magnitude of the eigenvectors, considering the values ??greater than |0.40| as representative of the variables most associated with each axis. The visualization of the scores and factor loadings was performed using a biplot, including 95% confidence ellipses for the different land use systems and differentiated symbolization by depth, with support from the factoextra package of the RStudio software (Team, 2023).
    
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Total nitrogen content in humic substances
    In all the evaluated coverages, the N content in the humic substances was higher in the surface layer, decreasing with the depth of the soil profile (Table 3). Y. Wang et al. (2024) highlighted that this distribution is typical of soils located in tropical climate regions, which have more condensed humic substance content in the surface layer. 
    The only exception was the Pasture area, which did not show significant differences in the AF-N and Hum-N contents between the different layers (Table 3), although, numerically, a reduction in these averages was observed with the deepening of the soil profile.
    Significant differences were observed in relation to the N contents between the different coverings in the 0-.010 m layer and in relation to the Hum-N content in the 0.10-0.20 m layer, and the other comparisons did not show significant differences between the areas (Table 3).

Capital letters compare the different types of land cover within the same layer, while lowercase letters compare the means of the same cover between the different soil layers. Cohen's d values ??indicate the size of the effect of the differences between the covers in relation to the Cerrado at each depth, and are considered small. (|d| ˜ 0.2), moderate (|d| ˜ 0.5) or large (|d| = 0.8) (Cohen, 2013). 
    
    As shown in Table 3, the highest mean values ??of N-FA, N-HA and N-Hum were observed in the eucalyptus area, with statistically significant differences in relation to Cerrado in the 0-0.10 m layer (p < 0.05). For N-FA, the eucalyptus showed an increase of 41% with high effect power in relation to the Cerrado (?M = 0.057 g kg?¹; 95%CI [0.020-0.094]; d = 0.940), while pasture registered a reduction of 17%. For N-HA, the difference between eucalyptus and agriculture was 18% (?M = 0.080 g kg?¹; 95%CI [0.025-0.135]; d = 0.870), with a 15% reduction in Agriculture in relation to Cerrado, balance values ??shown in Figure 2-A. 
    In N-Hum, Eucalyptus stood out with an increase of 38% in relation to Cerrado (?M = 0.196 g kg?¹; 95%CI [0.100-0.292]; *d* = 1.250), while Pasture showed a reduction of 21%.
    This pattern of enrichment of humic fractions was maintained up to a depth of 0.40 m, with increases ranging from 11% to 41% for N-FA, 3% to 18% for N-HA and 8% to 38% for N-Hum in Eucalyptus in relation to Cerrado (Figure 2-A). However, in the 0.30-0.40 m layer, N-HA showed an 8% reduction (?M = -0.150 g kg?¹; 95%CI [-0.310 to 0.010]; d = -0.540). In the 0.40-0.50 m layer, all fractions decreased compared to Cerrado: N-FA (-9%; ?M = -0.006 g kg?¹; 95%CI [-0.012 to 0.000]; d = -0.560), N-HA and N-Hum (-11%; ?M = -0.026 g kg?¹; 95%CI [-0.035 to 0.003]; d = -0.510), indicating lower stability of humic fractions at depth.
    These patterns suggest that the greater contribution of plant residues associated with the Eucalyptus forest cover contributed to the accumulation of nitrogen in the humic fractions of the soil, especially in the superficial layers. According to Oliveira et al. (2021), the maintenance of harvest residues in eucalyptus plantations favors the stabilization of particulate organic matter and the increase in soil organic carbon, especially due to the action of fungal biomass and the quality of the available litter. On the other hand, more intensive management practices, such as those applied in agricultural and pasture areas, tend to limit the incorporation of high-quality residues and intensify the mineralization processes of SOM, reducing the nitrogen retention capacity in the stable fractions, as evidenced by Yang et al. (2022), who reported a decrease in N retention in organic fractions associated with minerals under systems with greater soil disturbance.
    Among the factors that influence the total nitrogen content in the humic fractions of soil organic matter, the main ones are the quantity and quality of incorporated plant residues, as well as agricultural management practices (Bincy et al., 2023). These results reinforce the sensitivity of humic fractions as functional indicators of soil quality in relation to use and vegetation cover, especially in tropical environments under anthropogenic pressure.

Balance of losses and gains (%) in N contents in fulvic acids (N-AF), humic acids (N-AH) and humins (N-Hum) (%) in Plinthosol Pétrico in southern Tocantins, Brazil, at different depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 m), after conversion of Cerrado sensu stricto to Eucalyptus crops (a), Agriculture (b) and Pasture (c).

    The increase in average nitrogen levels in humic substances between 0-0.40 m may be associated with the greater accumulation of litter in the Eucalyptus area, combined with reduced soil disturbance resulting from the absence of intensive preparation. These factors favor the processes of humification and stabilization of nitrogen in the humic fractions of soil organic matter, as evidenced by Moraes et al. (2024), who observed increases in C and N levels in humic and labile fractions throughout a chronosequence of clonal Eucalyptus urophylla plantations in the Cerrado, with levels equal to or higher than those recorded in areas of native vegetation. 
    Physical and chemical characteristics of eucalyptus litter, in which coarser and more lignified materials are deposited in greater quantities than in pastures, increasing the C/N ratio of plant residues and reducing the speed of mineralization, and probably contributing to the humification process of the organic matter contributed (Pegoraro et al., 2011).
    The reduction in the levels of N-AF, N-AH and N-Hum observed in the last layer of the eucalyptus area (Figure 2-A) may be associated with the slow replacement of native vegetation and the transition in land use. However, studies have shown that, over time, the return of litter and low soil disturbance in eucalyptus plantations favor the gradual recovery of humic nitrogen fractions. This trend was evidenced by Ferreira et al. (2021), who observed an increase in the accumulation of particulate organic matter and mineral-associated organic matter in response to the retention of harvest residues, and by Marinho Junior, Piscoya, et al. (2021), whose results demonstrated that Eucalyptus sp. plantations presented carbon contents in the humic fractions higher than those observed in areas of native vegetation, suggesting stable accumulation of organic matter over time.
    In relation to the Agriculture area, an increase in the average values ??of N-FA (between 8% and 23%) and N-Hum (between 9% and 26%), and a reduction in N-HA contents (between 3% and 16%) were observed along the 0-0.50 m profile, when compared to the reference area (Cerrado) (Figure 2-B). In the 0-0.10 m layer, the average FA-N content was 8% higher than in the Cerrado (?M = 0.110 g kg?¹; 95%CI [-0.020 to 0.240] d = 0.420), while Hum-N increased by 26% (?M = 0.330 g kg?¹; 95%CI [0.090-0.570]; d = 0.950). The increases observed are probably attributed to the high deposition of plant residues in corn cultivation, which have slow decomposition due to the high C/N ratio, lignin content and other recalcitrant compounds, favoring the humification process to the detriment of the mineralization process, as also suggested by Pegoraro et al. (2018).
    The reductions in the average levels of N-HA in this area (Figure 2-B) may be related to changes in soil chemical conditions due to reduced soil acidity caused by liming. In this regard, L. Wang et al. (2025) highlighted the positive correlation between the soil acidity (pH < 5.5) and the formation of humic acids (HA), attributing this phenomenon to the stabilization of organic complexes in acidic conditions. This relationship is corroborated by Mockeviciene et al. (2022), who observed a 30% reduction in the proportion of HA after liming in tropical soils (pH increased to 6.0), due to the disruption of organometallic bonds and increased microbial activity. 
    On the other hand, Persson et al. (2021) associated liming with increased SOM mineralization, arguing that adjusting the pH to levels close to neutrality (5.5-7.0) favors the activity of heterotrophic bacteria. This hypothesis is reinforced by Mitsuta et al. (2025), who, in intensive corn systems under liming, observed a 35% increase in the SOM mineralization rate and N losses by leaching in the range of 20-40 kg ha?¹ year?¹. Similar results were reported for tropical soils, where raising the pH to 6.2 increased microbial activity (+25% in basal respiration) and nitrate leaching (+18%), especially in areas with intensive drainage. However, Powlson, Gregory, et al. (2011) point out that this dynamic varies according to management: in ecological systems such as crop-livestock-forest integration, moderate liming (pH 5.8-6.2) preserves up to 20% more HA than in conventional systems, thanks to the greater input of recalcitrant residues and less soil disturbance.
    The reduction in N-HA levels observed in the conversion of Cerrado areas for agricultural use may be associated with soil disturbance, which intensifies microbial activity and the decomposition of organic matter, reducing the stability of humic fractions. In this sense, Silva et al. (2024) showed that agricultural systems established on the native Cerrado vegetation showed a decrease in soil nitrogen and carbon stocks, in addition to a lower degree of humification, especially in the surface layers, as a result of intensive management and physical disturbance of the soil. In addition, Rosset et al. (2024) demonstrated that the maintenance of conservationist systems, such as long-term direct planting, favors the polymerization and the structural complexity of humic acids, promoting greater accumulation and stability of these compounds in the soil.
    The greater degradation of soil organic matter observed in pasture areas may be related to the chemical composition of plant residues, especially the lower C/N ratio characteristic of grasses, which favors rapid microbial decomposition. In addition, the low recalcitrance of these residues contributes to the lower stability of soil organic fractions, as demonstrated by Leal et al. (2024), who observed significant losses of carbon and nitrogen in converted native pastures, compared to areas of Eucalyptus and Acacia. The degradation of these areas is also directly associated with the management method adopted, as evidenced by Anésio et al. (2024), who reported lower accumulation of carbon and nitrogen in the soil in poorly managed pastures. On the contrary, adequate management strategies, such as controlling forage height in silvopastoral systems, promoted improvements in nutrient cycling and conservation of soil organic matter. 
    These same factors may be related to the lower N stocks in the humic substances of the pasture in this study, considering the advanced age of the area (over 40 years) and the lack of appropriate techniques in local management, which also impacted the N contents in the most stable fraction (N-Hum) of the MOS.
Total nitrogen stocks in humic substances
    Figure 3 shows the nitrogen stocks associated with the humic fractions (EstN) throughout the 0-0.50 m depth layer. For the N-FA fraction (Figure 3), the Eucalyptus area presented the highest significant mean value (0.911 Mg ha?¹), differing from the Pasture (0.691 Mg ha?¹) and the Cerrado (0.746 Mg ha?¹). The difference between Eucalyptus and Pasture was ?M = 0.220 Mg ha?¹ (95%CI [0.070-0.370]; d = 1.080), and between Eucalyptus and Cerrado, ?M = 0.165 Mg ha?¹ (95%CI [0.040-0.290]; d = 0.860), both with moderate to high power of effect. These results indicate a significant accumulation of N-FA in the forested area. 
    The Agriculture area presented an intermediate stock (0.824 Mg ha?¹), statistically similar to the other covers, as indicated by the overlap of the confidence intervals (?M = 0.087 Mg ha?¹ in relation to the Cerrado; 95%CI [-0.030 to 0.200]; d = 0.510), configuring a statistically homogeneous behavior pattern.
Figure 3. Stocks (Mg ha-1) of N in fulvic acids (EstN-AF) (A), humic acids (EstN-AH) (B) and humins (EstN-Hum) (C) in a Plinthosol in southern Tocantins state, Brazil, between 0-0.50 m depth, in the areas of Eucalyptus, Agriculture, Pasture and Cerrado sensu stricto. Means followed by the same letter do not differ from each other by the Tukey test at 5% probability.
   
    The highest significant mean values ??of EstN-AH occurred in Eucalyptus (1,276 Mg ha?¹), Pasture (1,244 Mg ha?¹) and Cerrado (1,243 Mg ha?¹) areas, which were statistically equal, while the Agriculture area presented the lowest significant mean value (1,071 Mg ha?¹), differing statistically from the other covers (Figure 3).
    The highest significant mean values ??of EstN-Hum occurred in the Eucalyptus (3,281 Mg ha?¹) and Agriculture (3,048 Mg ha?¹) areas, which were statistically equal, while the Pasture area presented the lowest significant mean value (2,418 Mg ha?¹), differing statistically from these covers (Figure 3). The Cerrado area presented intermediate EstN-Hum stocks compared to the other land covers (2,734 Mg ha?¹). The statistical results indicated that the average for this area and the other land covers were similar to each other (Figure 3).
    It can be seen that the average values ??of EstN-FA and EstN-Hum decreased numerically in the following order: Eucalyptus > Agriculture > Cerrado > Pasture, while the average values ??of EstN-AH decreased in the following order: Eucalyptus > Pasture ˜ Cerrado > Agriculture. 
    When compared to the reference area, the Eucalyptus area promoted an increase in the average N stocks in all humic substances, with increases of 22% (?M = 0.165 Mg ha?¹), 3% (?M = 0.033 Mg ha?¹) and 20% (?M = 0.547 Mg ha?¹), respectively in EstN-FA, EstN-AH and EstN-Hum.
    These results demonstrate the superiority of the Eucalyptus cover in the incorporation of N in the humic fractions of the MOS, compared to the Cerrado and other land uses. This pattern is associated with the input of plant residues with greater recalcitrance (e.g., high C/N ratio, ~80:1) as observed by Laclau et al. (2010), combined with less soil disturbance (70% reduction in soil disturbance compared to Agriculture).
    On the other hand, in the Cerrado-Agriculture conversion, an increase of 10% (0.078 Mg ha?¹) was observed in EstN-AF and 11% (0.314 Mg ha?¹) in EstN-Hum, but a reduction of 14% (-0.172 Mg ha?¹) in EstN-AH. This contrasting dynamic can be attributed to intensive soil disturbance, which favors the destructuring of aggregates and greater exposure of organic matter to microbial activity, accelerating the decomposition of the humic acid fraction. Studies show that conventional tillage alters the chemical composition of humic acids, promoting the loss of stable aromatic groups and an increase in oxidized compounds, which indicates a reduction in the stability and quality of soil organic matter (Ndzelu et al., 2021), as well as the application of acidity correctors, which alter the ideal chemical conditions for the stabilization of humic acids (Forrester et al., 2006).
    In addition, reducing soil acidity through liming also influences these dynamics, promoting increased nitrogen mineralization and modifying the availability of inorganic forms, which can negatively impact the incorporation of nitrogen into humic fractions (Mkhonza et al., 2020), as well as the possible influence of reducing acidity through soil liming (X. Wang et al., 2021).
    Regarding the Cerrado-Pasture conversion, there was an average reduction of 7% (-0.055 Mg ha-1) and 12% (-0.316 Mg ha-1), respectively in EstN-AF and EstN-Hum, while EstN-AH practically equaled that of the reference area.
    Although no statistically significant differences were observed between the mean nitrogen values ??in the humic fractions in the Pasture and Cerrado areas, the observed reductions may indicate changes in soil organic matter (SOM), possibly associated with the extensive form of management predominant in pastures. 
    This type of management, characterized by the absence of control over animal stocking, low technicalization and lack of investment in the soil correction and conservation, compromises the deposition of plant residues and reduces pasture productivity, contributing to the progressive degradation of SOM. Costa et al. (2022) reported that degraded pastures under extensive management and annual burning presented lower carbon stocks and higher N2O emissions compared to pastures improved with deep-rooted grasses and rotational grazing. In a complementary manner, Abán et al. (2025) demonstrated that the introduction of the perennial forage Brachiaria brizantha into degraded soils promoted substantial improvements in the soil structure, fertility and microbiology, highlighting the role of vigorous roots and microbial activity in the recovery of organic matter and nutrient cycling.

Representation of organic nitrogen in humic substances
       The representation of nitrogen present in humic substances in relation to the total nitrogen stock in the soil (N-S) was significant, corresponding to approximately 61%, 59%, 61% and 74% of the total N in the areas of Eucalyptus, Agriculture, Pasture and Cerrado, respectively (Figure 4-A). These values ??indicate that a substantial portion of soil nitrogen is protected in the humified fraction of soil organic matter (EstN-SH), due to the greater stability and resistance of these substances to the microbial decomposition. Jin et al. (2024) highlight that humic substances, such as humin and humic acids, function as nitrogen retention compartments, regulating its availability over time and protecting it against losses through volatilization or leaching. On the other hand, non-humified nitrogen, present in organic compounds such as aminoacids, organic acids and carbohydrates, is characterized by greater lability and rapid mineralization. This dynamic was evidenced by Amoakwah et al. (2024), who associated the accumulation of C and N in stable soil aggregates with the presence of humic substances, reinforcing their role in nutrient conservation in tropical environments.
Figure 4. Distribution (%) of soil N stock among humic and non-humic substances (a) and among humic fractions (b) in Plinthosol Petric in southern Tocantins state, Brazil, between 0-0.50 m depth, in the areas of Eucalyptus, Agriculture, Pasture and Cerrado sensu stricto. EstN-S = soil N stock; EstSH-N = N stock in humic substances; EstAF-N = N stock in fulvic acids; EstTAH-N = N stock in humic acids; EstHum-N = N stock in humins.

    In all environments evaluated, the average nitrogen stocks in humic substances were highest in the humin fraction, followed by the humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) fractions (Figure 4-B). These results are consistent with the findings of Freitas et al. (2022a), who reported greater nitrogen accumulation in the humin fraction in agrosilvopastoral systems, highlighting its contribution to the stability of N stocks in the soil. The predominance of this fraction reflects its high humification and structural complexity, in addition to the strong association with the mineral fraction of the soil, which confers low mobility and resistance to microbial degradation. Dias et al. (2023) corroborate this interpretation, pointing out that humin concentrates the largest carbon and nitrogen stocks among the organic fractions due to its more recalcitrant nature. 
    The fulvic acid (FA) fraction constitutes the least recalcitrant compartment of humic substances, being the most soluble and mobile, which makes it particularly susceptible to losses by leaching, especially in sandy textured soils. This characteristic may justify the lower nitrogen contents observed in this fraction. Recent studies highlight that, due to its lower molecular mass and high solubility, the FA fraction has greater mobility in the soil profile, which reduces its persistence and favors its export by percolation waters (Bagherifam et al., 2023). Additionally, in soils with a higher proportion of sand, a tendency towards an increase in the HA/FA ratio is observed, indicative of selective loss of the fulvic fraction and, consequently, of nitrogen associated with this labile fraction (Zhang et al., 2020).
       In general, systems that promote greater addition of plant residues and avoid soil disturbance create more favorable conditions for the formation of humic substances. This is due to the intensification of the condensation and polymerization reactions of organic material, resulting in more stable and complex fractions. Banach-Szott et al. (2020) demonstrated that no-tillage favors the formation of more humified humic acids, with structural characteristics indicative of greater stability, when compared to conventional cultivation with plowing (Banach-Szott et al., 2020). In addition, Kim et al. (2021) observed that the prolonged absence of residues in cultivation systems reduced the quality of soil organic matter and the microbial activity involved in humification, reinforcing the importance of conservation management. Such characteristics are strongly associated with the conditions observed in the Eucalyptus area of ??the present study.
The principal component Analysis - ACP
    The projection of the samples onto the plane formed by the first two principal components resulted in a joint explanation of 98.86% of the total variance, with PC1 explaining 94.02% and PC2 explaining 4.84% (Table 4). The separation of the samples along PC1 reflected a gradient of humic nitrogen accumulation, with samples from Agriculture positioned to the right of the axis and associated with the highest levels, while the Cerrado and Pasture areas were located to the left, indicating lower concentrations.
    The vertical distribution also influenced the clusters, with surface samples (0-0.10 m) concentrated in extreme regions of PC1, and deeper samples close to the center of the projection. These patterns suggest that both depth and land use type significantly influence the functional composition of organic matter and humic nitrogen stocks.
Table 4. Principal components (PC), eigenvalues, explained variance (%) and cumulative variance (%).
ComponentEigenvalueVariance (%)Cumulative VariancePC13,7608194.02%94.02%PC20,193654.84%98.86%PC30,044981.12%99.99%PC40,000550.01%100.00%    
    The PCA revealed multivariate patterns consistent with the influence of land use and management on the dynamics of nitrogen in the soil humic fractions (Figure 7). The first principal component (PC1) showed high positive correlations with all variables analyzed, being interpreted as an axis of general humic enrichment. This component synthesizes the integrated accumulation of nitrogen in the soil organic matter fractions, functioning as an indicator of the stability and conservation of SOM under different covers. This pattern was corroborated by Ortner et al. (2022), who identified, through PCA, that soils under conservationist management presented greater stability and accumulation of carbon and nitrogen in the humic fractions. 
    The PCA results are shown in figure 5. The intermediate position of the Eucalyptus cover along PC1, but still in the positive region, indicates a pattern of progressive and vertical accumulation of nitrogen, mainly in the recalcitrant fractions. This dynamic is associated with the constant deposition of litter rich in lignin and tannins and the absence of soil disturbance, which favors the humification of SOM and the accumulation of more stable compounds, such as humin. Freitas et al. (2022b) observed a similar pattern in agrosilvopastoral systems, where the presence of a tree canopy promoted greater stability and accumulation of C and N in the organic fractions.
    For the Cerrado sensu stricto, the negative position observed in PC1 reflects a stable dynamic of soil organic matter, marked by a lower contribution of plant residues and reduced mineralization rates, typical characteristics of preserved natural ecosystems. This stability is related to the presence of more resistant humic fractions and the physical-chemical protection promoted by gibbsite-type clays and iron oxides, which confer high recalcitrance to SOM under native vegetation (Santos et al., 2024). 
    The stratification of the samples by soil depth also revealed a clear gradient of humic enrichment along the profile. The samples from the most superficial layers (0-0.10 m and 0.10-0.20 m) were positioned primarily in positive regions of PC1, evidencing greater accumulation of humic N, while the samples from the deep layers (0.30-0.40 m and 0.40-0.50 m) were distributed closer to the origin or in the negative quadrants. This pattern confirms the superficial nature of nitrogen accumulation in the humic fractions and reinforces the influence of the type of vegetation cover and management as the main determinants of this accumulation.
    The second component (PC2) presented a strongly negative charge for N-HA (-0.855), contrasting with positive charges for total N and N-Hum, being interpreted as a gradient of functional dissociation, sensitive to qualitative changes in organic matter. This axis may reflect processes of structural transformation of SOM and the degree of humification of humic fractions, especially in response to management practices such as liming or tillage. Jiménez-González et al. (2022) demonstrated that more aromatic and recalcitrant nitrogen compounds, associated with humin, are indicative of systems with greater stabilization of SOM, and that less stable humic fractions such as humic acids respond more variably to soil conditions.
Figure 5. Principal component analysis (PCA) of nitrogen stocks in the humic fractions (N-FA, N-HA, N-Hum) and total nitrogen (N total) to evaluate the effects of land use systems and soil depth in a Plinthosol under Cerrado conditions. Land uses include: AGR - agricultural system with corn residue; EUC - eucalyptus plantation; PAS - Pasture; CER - native cerrado. Soil depths are represented by point shapes: 0-10 cm (circles), 0.10-0.20 m (triangles), 0.20-0.30 m (squares), 0.30-0.40 m (crosses) and 0.40-0.50 m (X marks). Ellipses represent the 95% confidence level for the multivariate clustering of each land use.


    In functional terms, PC1 was interpreted as an axis of total nitrogen enrichment in soil humic fractions, with a balanced contribution of all variables (N-FA, N-AH, N-Hum, and total N). PC2 reflected a dissociation between nitrogen associated with humic acid (N-AH), with a high negative factorial load, and the other fractions, with moderate positive loads. This dissociation suggests that PC2 may represent changes in the chemical quality of soil organic matter, reflecting variations in the degree of humification and relative stability of humic fractions. Such transformations are particularly associated with the intensity of agricultural and forestry management; studies show that systems under greater intervention present humic fractions with lower molecular complexity and stability, while areas under conservation management tend to preserve more recalcitrant and humified compounds (Tadini et al., 2022).

CONCLUSION
    In all evaluated coverings, the N-SH contents were numerically higher in the surface layers, decreasing in the subsequent layers, with emphasis on the Hum fraction.
    In general, the Eucalyptus area stood out for the greatest increases in the N-SH contents and stocks, demonstrating the benefits of this system on the soil.
    The losses in N-SH stocks in these systems indicated that the SOM was negatively altered, demonstrating the need for adaptations in the form of use and management, in order to promote greater contribution of organic matter and reduce soil disturbance.
    The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed the formation of structural groupings between the use systems based on the composition of humic nitrogen. The separation of the samples along the PC1 axis indicated a functional gradient of N-SH accumulation, with emphasis on Agriculture and Eucalyptus in the positive quadrants and Cerrado and Pasture in the opposite positions.
    The distribution of the samples evidenced the influence of depth, with a greater contribution of the superficial layers to the total stocks.
